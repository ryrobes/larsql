description: Test cascade for human evaluation of soundings with chart generation
  - each sounding creates a different chart visualization

  data_topic: A topic to visualize with data (e.g. 'monthly sales', 'user growth')
cells:
- instructions: 'Create a data visualization for {{ input.data_topic }}.


    You have tools to create charts. Make up realistic sample data and create a chart
    that would be useful for analyzing {{ input.data_topic }}.


    Be creative with:

    - Chart type (bar, line, pie, etc.)

    - Color scheme

    - Data representation

    - Meaningful titles and labels
