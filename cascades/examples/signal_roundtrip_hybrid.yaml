cascade_id: signal_roundtrip_hybrid
description: 'Self-contained hybrid demo combining deterministic phases with signals.
  Spawns an async producer that fires a signal, which this cascade receives. Run this
  single cascade to test the full flow.

    An async producer cascade has been spawned and will fire a signal shortly.

    Use await_signal to wait for signal ''roundtrip_demo'' with timeout ''30s''.

    The async producer may have encountered issues. Suggest troubleshooting steps.
