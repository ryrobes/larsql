    IMPORTANT: You should see:

    1. The ORIGINAL problem statement (via ''first'' keyword) with PROBLEM-001

    2. The REVIEW feedback (via ''previous'' keyword) with REVIEW-004


    You should NOT see BRAINSTORM-002 or DRAFT-003 - those phases are skipped!


    If you can see all the codewords, the context selection is NOT working correctly.'
