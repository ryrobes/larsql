  instructions: 'Does the PREMISE logically imply the CONCLUSION?


    PREMISE: {{ input.premise }}


    CONCLUSION: {{ input.conclusion }}


    Logical implication means: If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be
    true.


    Consider:

    - Does the premise contain information that leads to the conclusion?

    - Is the conclusion a reasonable inference from the premise?

    - Would the premise being true make the conclusion likely true?


    IMPORTANT!

    Respond with ONLY "true" or "false" - no explanation, no code fences, no wrappers.
