    Scoring guide:

    - 0.0-0.2: No relation or contradicts the criterion

    - 0.2-0.4: Weak/tangential connection

    - 0.4-0.6: Moderate relevance, partial match

    - 0.6-0.8: Strong relevance, good match

    - 0.8-1.0: Excellent match, directly addresses criterion


    Respond with ONLY a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0.

    No explanation, no other text.
