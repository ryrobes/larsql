# TOPICS - Semantic Topic Dimension
# A dimension function that extracts topics from a collection and assigns each value to a topic.
#
# SQL Usage:
#   SELECT state, TOPICS(title, 8) as topic, COUNT(*)
#   FROM bigfoot_vw
#   GROUP BY state, TOPICS(title, 8)
#
#   -- With custom focus:
#   SELECT TOPICS(observed, 5, 'creature behavior') as behavior_type, COUNT(*)
#   FROM bigfoot_vw
#   GROUP BY TOPICS(observed, 5, 'creature behavior')

  Semantic topic dimension function. Extracts N topics from a collection of texts,
  then assigns each text to the most relevant topic.

  This is a DIMENSION-shaped function for use in GROUP BY clauses.

inputs_schema:
  texts: JSON array of all text values to analyze
  num_topics: Number of topics to extract (default 8)
  focus: Optional focus/hint for topic extraction

sql_function:
  name: topics
  description: |
    Extract topics from text collection and assign each text to a topic.
    First arg is the column, remaining args are modifiers.

  shape: DIMENSION
  mode: mapping  # Returns {mapping: {value: topic}}

  args:
    - name: text
      type: VARCHAR
      role: dimension_source  # This is the column to bucket
    - name: num_topics
      type: INTEGER
      default: 8
    - name: focus
      type: VARCHAR
      default: null

  returns: VARCHAR
  cache: true

    instructions: |
      Analyze these {{ input.texts | length }} texts and:
      1. Extract {{ input.num_topics | default(8) }} meaningful topic categories
      2. Assign each text to its best-matching topic

      {% if input.focus %}
      Focus on: {{ input.focus }}
      {% endif %}

      Texts to analyze (with index numbers):
      {% for v in input.texts %}
      [{{ loop.index0 }}] "{{ v | replace('"', '\\"') }}"
      {% endfor %}

      Return a JSON object mapping each text's INDEX NUMBER to its assigned topic:

      {
        "mapping": {
          "0": "Topic Name A",
          "1": "Topic Name B",
          ...
        }
      }

      IMPORTANT:
      - Use the INDEX NUMBER (0, 1, 2, ...) as keys, NOT the original text
      - Topic names should be concise but descriptive (2-5 words)
      - Every input text must be assigned to exactly one topic
      - Return ONLY the JSON object

    rules:
      max_turns: 1
      max_attempts: 3 # since we are using output_schema, loop_until validation is implied if max_attempts > 1

    output_schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        mapping:
          type: object
      required:
        - mapping
