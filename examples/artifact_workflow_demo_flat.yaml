  Demonstrates the complete artifact workflow:
  1. Iterate on visualizations with request_decision (HTMX blocking)
  2. Publish final polished version with create_artifact (persistent)

  Shows how artifacts become permanent gallery items while request_decision
  is ephemeral iteration tool.

      ## Workflow (Each Sounding Explores Different Visualizations):

      1. **Get Data (you have many tools at your command)

      2. **Create a professional and data-dense Dashboard**


  - name: finalize
    tackle: ["create_artifact"]
    instructions: |
      Artifact created: {{ outputs.draft_and_iterate.artifact_id }}
      (Please create it, if not done already)

      Provide a summary of:
      - What the artifact contains
      - Key insights from the data
      - How to access it (Artifacts gallery)

    context:
      from: [draft_and_iterate]
