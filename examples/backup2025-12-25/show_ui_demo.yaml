    instructions: |
      Perform a comprehensive analysis of: {{ input.topic }}

      Build a rich visual narrative by calling show_ui multiple times:

      1. **Introduction**: Write markdown explaining what you'll analyze

      2. **Data Overview**: Use show_ui to display:
         - A Plotly bar chart showing key metrics
         - Title: "Data Overview"
         - Include sample/synthetic data inline

      3. **Trend Analysis**: Write markdown explaining trends, then use show_ui to display:
         - A Vega-Lite line chart showing trends over time
         - Title: "Trend Analysis"

      4. **Key Findings**: Use show_ui to display:
         - An interactive table with top 10 findings
         - Include filter/sort functionality
         - Title: "Top Findings"

      5. **Summary**: Write final markdown summary with conclusions

      Each show_ui call creates an inline visualization that appears in the conversation.
      Mix markdown explanations between visualizations for a rich narrative.

      Remember: show_ui returns immediately, so you can call it multiple times and
      continue your analysis without waiting for user interaction.
