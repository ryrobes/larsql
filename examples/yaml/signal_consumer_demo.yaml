description: Demonstrates await_signal - waits for external events before proceeding. Run this cascade
  and then fire the signal from CLI or another cascade.

      We're starting the data processing pipeline. First we need to wait for upstream data to be ready.

      Use the await_signal tool to wait for the 'data_ready' signal with a 10 minute timeout.

      Describe what you're waiting for: 'Waiting for upstream ETL pipeline to complete'

  - handoffs:
      - complete
    instructions: "The signal was received! The payload contains:\n\n{{ state.output_start_processing\
      \ }}\n\nExtract the information from the payload and simulate processing the data. Describe what\
      \ you would do with this information."

  - instructions: |-
      The signal timed out. We didn't receive the expected data in time.

      Explain what happened and suggest next steps:
      1. Check if the upstream pipeline failed
      2. Retry the wait
      3. Alert the team

      Processing complete! Summarize what was done:

      1. Waited for upstream signal
      2. Received the data payload
      3. Processed the information

      The cascade is now complete.
