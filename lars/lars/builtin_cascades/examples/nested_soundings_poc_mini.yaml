description: 'Mini version of nested takes POC for quick testing.

  Demonstrates cascade-level takes containing phase-level takes

  with multi-model execution and iterative reforge.

    You''re seeing winning solutions from TWO independent planning runs.

    Each went through 3 model attempts + 2 reforge iterations.


    ## Evaluation Criteria

    - Solution Quality (40%) - Feasibility, correctness

    - Depth of Thought (30%) - Trade-offs, anticipates challenges

    - Clarity (30%) - Actionable, well-structured


    ## Decision

    Pick the winner. Format:

    ```

    WINNER: [0 or 1]

    REASONING: [2-3 sentences]

    ```


    If both are roughly equal with complementary strengths, merge them:

    ```

    WINNER: MERGED

    MERGED_SOLUTION: [synthesized solution]

    ```
