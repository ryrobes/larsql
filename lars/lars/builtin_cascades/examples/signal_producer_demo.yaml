description: Demonstrates fire_signal - fires a signal to wake up waiting cascades.
  Run signal_consumer_demo first, then run this to fire the signal.
cells:
- handoffs:
  - fire_completion_signal
  instructions: 'Simulate completing some upstream work (like an ETL pipeline).


    Describe the work being done:

    - Extracting data from source

    - Transforming records

    - Loading to destination


    When done, proceed to fire the signal to notify waiting cascades.'
  name: simulate_work
- instructions: 'The upstream work is complete! Now fire the ''data_ready'' signal
    to wake up any waiting cascades.


    Use the fire_signal tool with:

    - signal_name: ''data_ready''

    - payload: {"table": "analytics.events", "row_count": 150000, "status": "complete"}


    This will wake up any cascades waiting on this signal.'
  name: fire_completion_signal
- instructions: 'Signal fired! Any cascades waiting for ''data_ready'' should now
    continue.


    Report the result from the fire_signal tool:

    {{ state.output_fire_completion_signal }}'
  name: complete
