    ## Task

    {{ input.task }}


    ## Your Process


    1. **Analyze the task** and identify any decisions that need human input

    2. **When you need a decision**, use the `request_decision` tool

    3. **Continue working** with the human''s response


    ## About the request_decision Tool


    Use this tool when you encounter choices, ambiguities, or decisions that

    would benefit from human input. Provide:

    - A clear question

    - 2-4 distinct options (each with id, label, and description)

    - Context explaining why this decision matters

    - Severity level (info/warning/error)


    The tool will pause and wait for the human to choose. Their response

    comes back with the selected option ID, so you can act on it immediately.


    Now analyze the task and proceed. Use request_decision whenever you

    encounter something that needs human judgment.
