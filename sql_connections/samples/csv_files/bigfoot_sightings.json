Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.",

As i ascended the trail I heard a large animal moving in the forest about 20 yards off the trail. I couldn''t see it but could clearly hear it in the underbrush.  As i proceeded up the trail one of my friends was in the trail looking at something.  A set of very large footprints were in the trail.  This was about 200 yards up from were i heard the noises.  The track came from off the trail onto it and proceeded down the trail about 30-50.  The subject walked a few steps the stopped and stood still moved a few more feet stopped as if listening.  It proceedded down the trail a few more yards before heading into a small meadow.  This meadow is very near the place i head the noises in the bush.  The foot prints were in very deep silty powder and were very well detailed.  I could see the lines in the sole of the foot the toes were very splayed and there was little to no arch.  total lenght of the prints was about 14-15\" as I could fit my whole foot shoe and all in the print.  The track was liad down on top of the tracks of my friends who were about 5 min. ahead of us.  A couple of bear hunters came upon us and we asked them what they thought, and they had never seen such a track. After loosing the track off of the road we proceeded with our ride.  About one half mile up the road the track apeared again fromm off the road moving across the road going downhill toward the previous site of prints.  The bear hunters also found the new tracks and tired to follow it but the brush was too thick. ",

This lasted for around 5 minutes. The entire time none of us could make out a single word. Yet it sounded English. We basically figured that it was a crew of people looking for the animal making the first howl. Even though it was obvious that the original sound came from miles away.

The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep. Their was a sand bar and the boulders were at least 30 to 40 lbs. ",

Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    ",

      "observed": " In late August of 1981 I heard a distinct distant wailing animal call similar in character to some of the recordings posted on the BFRO website. I was backpacking with two other people in California''s Sierra Nevada mountains, near the northern boundary of Kings Canyon National Park. About a year later I wrote down a very detailed description of the event. I have always wanted to report this to some appropriate organization, so now that I have found the BFRO site, here it is.<BR><BR>I was 16 at the time of the event. I am now 37. The following is a refined version of a description I wrote one year after the event.<BR><BR>I was on a backpacking trip with two family friends who were about my parent''s age. Our destination was the Devil''s Punchbowl in California''s Sierra Nevada mountains which is about a 19-mile hike on good trails from the parking lot at Courtright Reservoir. [You can find a topo map of the area at http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=11&n=4112372&e=335727&s=50&size=m] The first night we camped at a place called Long Meadow. The second day was a long hike to Fleming Lake (elevation about 9600 feet,) where we made camp just before sunset. Our camp was at the northeast corner of the lake, about 50 yards from the shore, up against a low, steep granite slope. We were the only people camped at that lake that evening. The two adults set about making dinner, and I went fishing at the lake since the fish were jumping vigorously. I started at the point on the lakeshore that was closest to the campsite and worked my way around the north edge of the lake towards the west. It was starting to get dark, the wind was virtually calm, and it was so quiet and peaceful that I could clearly hear occasional sounds from camp about 100 yards away: talking and the clinking of cookware. I was really focused on the fishing since I was very eager to catch something before it got too dark.<BR><BR>I was changing a lure when I heard the sound. It was a distant wailing coming from the north/northeast, up a broad open valley, to my left. Fleming Creek runs through this valley. This call is very hard to describe, but one could describe it as human- or primate-like in its smooth, round character. The call was broken up into segments that rose and fell in pitch. Each segment lasted about 1.5 seconds and each followed immediately after the one before it, like \"oooOOo, oooOOo, oooOOo\" with the pitch and volume rising in the middle of each segment and trailing off abruptly at the end. There were about six segments in the call, making the total call length about 10 seconds. The sound was somewhere between an \"oooo\" and a \"wow\" sound.<BR><BR>I froze immediately upon hearing this. It did not really scare me, but it commanded all of my attention. I heard it very clearly though it was faint and obviously far away. I would guess its origin could have been anywhere from one to two miles away, up the valley to the north/northeast. As I said it was very calm that evening and sound carries far in conditions like that. The call stopped after the first six \"oooOOo\" segments, and I immediately and very consciously decided that I was hearing things and ignored it and went back to working on my lure. Then I heard it again and there was no ignoring it. There was a total of five or six very clear, distinct calls made up of about five or six \"oooOOo\" segments each. The entire event lasted maybe 45 seconds or a minute.<BR><BR>Once the second call started I stopped what I was doing and listened very carefully as the call repeated. I was definitely not hearing things. It was not the wind, since the breeze was barely a whisper. I was in an open meadow with a lake immediately in front of me and a tree-covered granite mountain behind me. The sound was not echoing, as there was nothing for it to echo against, and the sound did not trail off as it repeated as an echo does. It started and stopped very deliberately.<BR><BR>This spooked me and I packed up all my fishing gear and went back to camp. I told the others that I had heard an animal call of some kind and asked them if they had heard anything but they had not. My guess is that the sound was masked by the noises from their own activities and the steep but low granite slope behind them. I forced myself not to think about it much, since we still had four nights to spend out there and we were headed deeper into the mountains. I did not hear, see, feel, or smell anything unusual for the rest of the trip, though I was pretty keyed up and attentive after that.<BR><BR>Regarding the quality of the sound:<BR><BR>About a month after I got back from the trip I read in John Green''s book \"On the Track of the Sasquatch\" the description of the Puyallup recordings from 1973. It describes very well the quality of the call I heard: The unidentified noise is not an \"eeeee\" scream, but more of a long \"whooOooOooOoo\" or \"whoopwhoopwhoop\" at a high pitch and with immense volume. Heard from a distance it can be compared with the sound of a siren far off but it definitely is not that. When I first read that I got chills all over and I felt a little shocked, since that is an extremely good way to describe what I heard.<BR><BR>I recently found your website and listened to all the supposed Sasquatch sound recordings, and the sound I heard could easily have been made by the same source. But the sounds on your website are mostly long wails or howls, and what I heard undulated up and down fairly rapidly. The voice itself sounded like a cross between the 1973 Puyallup sounds and the 1993 Del Norte County \"angry Bigfoot\" scream. But what I heard did not sound in the least threatening. In retrospect, it seemed as if the caller were simply announcing to everyone that it was present. Though there were multiple calls, they all seemed to come from the same source, from the same direction. I did not hear anything that sounded like an answer.<BR><BR>To my mind there is no way this could have been a person unless they were playing with an amplifier. The noise was obviously far away and I find it hard to believe anyone (short of an opera singer) could project a call like that over such a distance. There were not that many people out there anyway. Since then I have heard coyotes, owls, horses, donkeys, grouse, and other animals in the wild, and they don''t sound anything at all like what I heard. I have never to my knowledge heard a cougar, so I guess that is a possibility. I have heard that there could have been elk in that area, but I have listened to several elk bugles on the Web, and none of them are remotely like what I heard. Those elk recordings sound like someone trying to make a sound on a saxophone for the first time (dry and squawking), and what I heard had a very smooth \"primate\" quality.<BR>",
      "alsonoticed": "As we approached Fleming Lake, the trail followed Fleming Creek which was maybe 100 feet below in a ravine. The bottom of the ravine was thickly covered with brush and trees. Down in the ravine we all clearly heard what sounded like a person or a large animal moving at a walking pace downstream (opposite direction of us.) It sounded like someone moving through thick brush and occasionally breaking branches, not even trying to be quiet. Later, my guide told me she thought it was a bear, since she had experience with them in this area before. To this day I have no reason to think otherwise.",

I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.  Van had grown up in Minnesota hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers.  I decided we should take his advice.  We left and back tracked to Van''s Toyota Landcruiser.  We went over to Bass lake to fish for the rest of the weekend.",

The last two hikes have really changed that. After todays hike has me thinking that we may not ever go back, Im not sure. We were hiking along, gabbing and visiting.

It wasnt a raven, a fox, a bear, a lion, a deer bleet, a chipmunk, or a hawk. It was sounded like a human, but the fact that it traveled through the woods so clearly and loud really shook all of us.

It stopped my mother, me and my son in our tracks. There was no doubt that we all heard the same thing.

I was dreaming I was trying to sleep but there was noise outside so in my dream I got out of bed and went to my window and pulled back the curtain.  I started tapping on the window to let whoever was outside know they were being noisy and disrupting my effort to try to sleep.   After my third tap on the window, I woke up from my dream and realized I had to go to the bathroom.  I got up and made my way to the toilet.  My bedroom window was open and my bathroom window was open.  Just before I flushed, I heard a faint noise, and I started to think it was a motorcycle coming around the bend on the highway, and in that second I thought to myself Who would be riding a motorcycle this early in the morning?. Then, the noise got louder and drawn out, and had a deep vibrating howl, and then it stopped.  I realized then that it was something I have never heard before and it was not human.  It sounded like it was on one of the mountains behind my house.  <BR><BR>Afterwards, I noticed there were no dogs barking, not even my dogs, and there werent even any crickets.  It was dead silence outside.  I was telling myself, oh my god, did I just hear what I think I heard?  I headed back to bed and noticed the clock said 3:33am. I asked my husband if he was awake. He had been snoring when I was in the bathroom.  I told him I had just heard something.  I explained the sound to him and I said I think it was a Bigfoot.  I could not believe what I had heard.  I could not sleep for over an hour, and we laid in bed waiting for more howling but there was none.  <BR><BR>The next day when I told everyone in the house, nobody had heard it.  Later Sunday morning, I used my cell phone to google different animal sounds to try to find the same howl I heard.  I tried Mountain lion, Wolf, Fisher, Fox, and none of them are in the least bit similar.  Then, I googled Bigfoot howls.  Oh my god! The 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl is almost exactly what I heard.  I got chills when I listened to it.  I played the recording to my household, and my oldest adult son recognized the sound also.  He as well as a few of his friends have had a few experiences too, including a rock being thrown at him. He has the rock in his bedroom.  I phoned my other family members and told them what I experienced and my mom told me that there was a post on facebook about a week earlier from someone that lives a few blocks away from me.  She was returning home late at night near the local dump (between Hoopa and Willow Creek, California).  Apparently, she thought she saw something near the highway and so did the car behind her as the other car turned around and drove back.   This location is only a couple of mountains away from where my home is located.  I figure the Bigfoot traveled to Hoopa from the dump site.   <BR><BR>I have lived in this area (Weitchpec and Hoopa, CA) almost my entire life and I have never, ever heard such a howl.  I think about the experience daily, but I actually feel fortunate to have witnessed this rare creature howling.  <BR><BR>Debbie Bailey<BR>",

The road makes a few turns and the speed limit drops in the area. As I rounded a sweeping right hand turn I saw a figure on the south bound shoulder of the highway. I was the only vehicle in the area about 8:15 PM.   My speed was about 45-50 MPH as I passed the figure. The figure was laying on the shoulder of the road on its right side. I estimated the height to be about 7. I was looking at the creatures back and noticed it had broad shoulders and was thick torso shape. While the shape similar to a human it was not human. It was not a bear either. I could see muscular features in its glutes and a head on the shoulders that was somewhat tapered toward the top and being held off the ground. Its hair was a chocolate brown and very course. The hair was not fur like of a  bear at all. <BR><BR>I turned around a distance past the spot and returned to where I had seen it.  No other vehicles had gone north or south from the time I saw the creature to the time I returned to its location (2 minutes estimate).

I spent every summer camping in that area as well as a kid. I have never seen anything like what I saw just this evening. ",

We started to get a little freaked out, so we started a fire, and heard nothing for the next 3 or 4 hours. Then at about 10:30 11:00 p.m. the screaming started again, this time lasting for about 10 minutes. It sounded like it was about half a mile away on one of the surrounding ridges, a very eerie wail.

We all wanted to camp in a bigfoot area, so we we went to a campground near Bluff Creek.  We were all in the tent and in our bags, the camp had settled down and all of a sudden there was a whoop! They were loud as if behind us, in succession whoop whoop bah-whoop!! And it seemed that there was more than one, I estimate three, one to the left of us, one behind us, and one off in front at a distance.  Also, something either took a large step or jumped off something, and it was big. The one behind us would call first and the one off in the distance would call back. The one to the left would whoop once, but the one behind would whoop three times and the others once or twice. At the start of the whoops would be almost a pucker or click sound. I figure the one behind us was the lead because he would call out and they would answer. <BR><BR>After about ten minutes the lead creature started to move off with the one to the left towards the other. I wanted to look out the tent but my youngest was with me who is 6 and was real scared, because the calls were so loud. I stayed with him and did not get to look till it was over. <BR><BR> I found no evidence in the morning, but earlier that day I noticed there were markings on a tree that was not made by a bear, almost as if the bark had been picked off. I have always followed this phenomenon and believed there was a possibility. This solidified everything. ",

I had been driving for quite some time and had decided to pull into Humboldt Redwood State Park.  Being from Alabama, I figured seeing these big redwoods would be kind of cool. <BR><BR> So, I got off of Hwy 101 and took the Avenue of the Giants exit.  Driving down the road I was amazed at the size of the trees, so they kind of grabbed my attention. I started seeing a lot of places where I was thinking I could fish, so I started to slow down even more to find a place to park.  As I kept driving the river kind of started getting a little farther away, and I was about to turn around. <BR><BR>When out of no where something walked across the road, and to say the least it shocked the you know what out of me.  The reason why it got me a little jumpy was because of the fact that I had to have come within a couple of feet of this thing.  Now I''m a pretty big guy 6'' and about 220 Lbs., but what ever walked in front of my truck had to have been over 7 feet tall, due to the height of the truck (Chevy Z71). <BR><BR>Now when it comes to the poundage of this thing I would have to say it was well over 350 lbs.  As far as physical features all I saw was the back and arm swing. The thing never turned around for me to get a better look at it.  But it had a large back and rather long arms.  As far as the neck goes it didnt really have one.  The animals traps made it look like it didnt have a neck.  Kind of like me.  <BR><BR>But after I did find a place to turn around, I went back to look around, dumb I know, to say the least.  I only found a couple of tracks. They had to have been 14 to 15 inches long, plus the stride of this thing was a lot longer then mine. Just to make the stride this thing did, I had to make one heck of an effort.  Now all I can say is what ever I saw that day was nothing like anything I had ever seen in the woods, and I grew up in the outdoors.<BR>",

I had been coming to this area for the past couple of months and started to learn it a little better.  So I decided to go exploring for some fishing holes.  All I had with me at the time was a fishing rod and a GPS receiver so I wouldnt get lost. <BR><BR> I parked the truck and started out on foot. I had talked to two local fishermen about what was in these rivers, and what to use. Im from the south and this area was like a new world.  So I made my way down to the river along the side of the bank.  At times the going got a little hard but I managed.  I tried several places but the water was moving too fast, so I thought that I would try and find a slack part of the river, where the flow was a little slower.  Now these woods are a lot different than the ones I was used to, so I was a little excited about this new area.<BR><BR> I had been walking for maybe 45 minutes and covered maybe two miles when I saw something in the distance.  At first I thought that it was just a stump, seeing that I had left my glasses in the truck.  Now my vision isnt that bad, but I still need them for driving.  But, I started feeling a little uneasy due to an earlier encounter, plus it might have been a bear. <BR><BR>But, being the idiot that I am, I had to get closer.  I got to within about 75 yards, because I was using the tree line as cover. That was as close as I wanted to get.  You could say that my heart was beating out of my chest it was like I had buck fever.  Well now that I was within good sight of the creature. It was easy to see what it was.  It finally stood up, and I didnt know up until that point how big it really was.  <BR><BR>Now, I had a roommate who was 6''7 and this creature would have easily stood over him.  At the best guess I would have to say that it was 7''6 tall, and it had to weigh over 400lbs.  It finally turned to me and made me out in a second, but when it turned, it didnt run away instantly.  It just stood there.  I guess it was trying to see what I was. We must have looked at each other for 10 seconds or so, but it felt like 10 minutes. And in that time all I could see was that the creature had dark reddish brown hair, and the arms easily hung down to the creatures knees. <BR><BR>But within an instant something spooked it. The creature turned and looked down river, and it just took off.  Now the ground that this thing covered was amazing.  I didnt move for a good bit, because I was in shock.  After the creature had left, I did the same, once I could get my feet working again. <BR>",

The first night we stayed at Onion Lake on Onion Mountain located on forest service road 13NO1. We spent all afternoon setting up camp, takeing pictures and looking around Onion Lake for Sasquatch evidence. Around 9 p.m, just as it got dark, we heard a loud grunt roar down from a hill top just above our camp. The grunt we heard can only be described as something exhaling a great amount of air all at onece. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. My brother turned to me and said,\"WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT\"? At that moment a deer ran down the hill from the direction of the grunt and into our camp. Then out of the darkness, another grunt roared through the forest from our right at a distance we thought was about 100-150 yards out from our camp. Then we heared a grunt that strait out from our camp that was at least 400-500 yards out. Then we heared the grunt from up on top of the hill again. Then the grunt to our right answered the grunt on top of the hill and then we heared the grunt that was out 400-500 yards answer the grunt on top of the hill and the grunt to our right. It was as if what ever it was makeing these sounds were communicating back and forth to one another. This grunting was very intense for the fist hour or so then it calmed down a little through out the rest of the night. The last grunt we heared was around 5 a.m just before first light. At one time around 10 p.m, we heared a loud grunt come from behind us over by Onion Lake. I turned on my three miliion candle spot light and searched the forest in the direction we heared the grunt but saw nothing. That grunt could not of been no more than 100 yards away from us and was very loud and rough. Around that same time the other grunts seemed to getting closer to our camp as well and we were starting to get scared. We huddled together in the middle of our camp with our rifles and shotguns in hand along with our three million candle spot light in hand ready to take on what ever it was makeing these loud grunts. We were hearing something we had never heard before in the woods and what ever it was, it sounded like it was VERY BIG by the sound of the grunts these things were makeing. We were scared. If it was not for the firearms we took with us we would of thrown all of our camping gear into our vehicle and we would''ve left a dust cloud a half mile high and twenty miles long as we were getting the heck out of there. We got up the next morning and looked around a little but we did''nt see or hear anything. What ever it was makeing these grunts, they were nocturnal animals and they were only active at night. We could also tell the animals were moveing around in the forest from grunt to grunt. Example: the grunts would get loud and would come from a specific location in the woods and then the next grunt would come from the same general location but a little to the right or left and a little closer or further away than tha grunt before. But we never did hear anything walking through the dry under brush. What ever they were makeing these grunts, they move through the woods very quietly with no sound at all except for their grunts. We packed our camping equipment into our vehicle and we spent the next night down at Louse Camp on Bluff Creek. That night we had no visitors and we returned home to Eureka the next morning. About one month after we returned from our expedition to Onion Lake and Bluff Creek, I was watching a show on the Discovery Channel about Ball Pythons in India. A large fifteen foot snake was crawling on the ground in the jungle as a family of monkeys were going crazy at the sight of the snake. These monkeys looked alot like Chimpanzees but the had black faces and black fur. At one moment, a large male monkey made a loud grunt as he threw a stick at the snake. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. I came flying off the coutch and said to myself,\"thats what we heared at Onion Lake\". The grunt the monkey made at the snake on the Discovery Channel was the same tone, roughness, length and sounded exactly like the grunt we heared the night of July 5, 2004 at Onion Lake. The Sasquatch is thought to be a large primate of somekind and my brother and I heared loud grunts comeing out the forest at Onion Lake. These grunts I later heared a monkey make on T.V in India. The monkeys grunts were identical to the grunts we heared at Onion Lake. I''m not a scientist or expert on grunts, but I think this is very interesting. My brother and I were raised here in Humboldt County, California and have lived here in the heart of Bigfoot country all our lives. We have been interested in the Sasquatch/Bigfoot for as long as we can remember and we plan on makeing other Bigfoot expeditions in the future because the sounds we heared comeing out of the woods at Onion Lake on the night of July 5, 2004 makes us wonder even more now about whats really out there.",
      "alsonoticed": "The deer that ran down the hill into our campsite along with a few other deer stayed right next to our campsite, about 25-40 feet away from our tent all night as these grunts went on out in the woods. The deer showed no fear of our presence. The acted like they were more comfortable around us, humans, than out there in the woods with what ever it was grunting.",
      "otherwitnesses": "Two witnesses total. My brother and I. My Brother and I had just ate dinner and we were watching a few deer that were grazeing around Onion Lake and our campsite just before we heared the first grunt at about 9 p.m.",

One report said after the grunt, they heared what sounded like something flapping its lips together.",

      "observed": " Last Sunday (November 16, 2003) My friend, my dog and I traveled from Portland, OR to Northern California for some late season backpacking. We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans, CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6:00pm, as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host, and as we approached the host''s site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So, we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive \"skunky\" odor, but thought nothing of it at the time.<BR><BR>Eventually we pulled into a campsite (second or third from the entrance at the foot of a large hill). Our intent was to get out of the pickup (leaving the dog inside), get on our rain gear and set up the tent as quickly as possible, as it was already quite dark and raining. Just after donning my rain gear, however, I heard some distinct \"hoots\" from within the woodline which were decidedly not owl-like nor quite human-like, but could be most accurately likened to those of an ape. I asked my friend if he had heard that, but he had not, as he had two hoods pulled up over his head. I quickly scanned the woodline with my head lamp, seeing nothing out of the ordinary through the dark and rain. We began setting-up the tent when I heard it again. \"There.\" I said, \"Did you hear it that time?\"<BR><BR>\"No.\" he responded, but he did pull his hoods down. Shortly thereafter we both heard another set of \"hoots\".<BR><BR>\"What do you think that is?\" he asked.<BR><BR>I have had a casual interest in the Sasquatch phenomenon since childhood and find its existence to be scientifically plausible. I am also quite comfortable in the wilderness, having spent much of my life in the outdoors from Alaska to Costa Rica professionally, academically and recreationally, but I never honestly expected to experience anything first-hand with such a creature. So, being educated and reasonable, I declined to respond.<BR><BR>As we continued, we began hearing other noises. First we heard \"whacking\" sounds of wood against wood (more probably stick against tree). Perceiving this \"hooting\" and \"whacking\" as a less-than-friendly display, we became a little nervous and contemplated leaving; but curiousity and the dread of packing up, moving to an unplanned location and reconstructing in the dark, while already soaked; compelled us to stay. So, we continued constructing the tent between periodic scans of the area.<BR><BR>The \"whacking\" continued and we noticed it would come from different locations in short sequence (too short for one individual to move from point A to point B). Again my friend asked: \"What do you think that is?\"<BR><BR>I gave the guarded response: \"I''ll tell you what, I''ve spent alot of time in the woods and observed alot  of animals, but I''ve never heard anything like this.\" I assume he read through the evasion to the meaning of my response, given the ubiquitous usage of the word \"Bigfoot\" , and images thereof, in the surrounding communities and some casual conversation we had had on the subject during our drive.<BR><BR>Shortly before turning in for the evening, I heard a short series of what sounded like heavy footsteps on the rocky terrain of the hillside, in the rhythm of a two-legged walk. Turn in we did, however, with senses piqued and dog tucked securely within the tent. We slept intermittently and restlessly hearing sounds throughout the night.  Most frequently we heard the \"whacking\"; most regularly a rather hollow-sounding report originating from a point some distance to our Northeast and up the hill. We would, however, periodically hear closer and clearer \"whacks\" from varying locacations to our general Southeast; once hearing a disturbingly close and firm \"whack\" from our South/Southwest. <BR><BR>I awoke, once, at approximately 3:00am and heard distinct, single-note \"whistles\" from the general direction of the distant, hollow \"whacking\" which were, again, decidedly unbirdlike, yet not quite human. Soon thereafter we were all startled upright by a \"crack\" followed by loud rockslide, terminating distressingly close to our location. My friend informed me he had heard two other, smaller slides earlier that night. After all was quiet for some time (except the perpetual \"whacking\") we eventually slumbered down again, awakening to sunlight and (finally) quiet surroundings.<BR><BR>In the daylight we observed that the hillside was quite steep, rocky and slightly parabolic in shape, and the rock slide ended up in our South adjacent campsite, leading us to conclude that: 1. Inspection of the hillside would be dangerous and turn up little or nothing in the way of footprints; 2. Sounds could have originated from well up the hill and carried down the \"amphitheater\" hillside; 3. If it were people playing a prank, they must be extremely dedicated to risk their lives negotiating that hill in the dark and rain and to wait in the woods any given night for the off-chance campers might come by in November; 4. Though rock slides may naturally occur there on occasion, they certainly must not occur on the order of three a night or someone would implement measures to ensure no one camp in that location; 5. Maybe that \"skunky\" smell we had encountered just previously was not a skunk.<BR><BR>At any rate we drove on the next morning to the Willow Creek Ranger''s Office (making no mention of the events) to inquire as to open trails. We were instructed that much of the back country road system (and corresponding trails) was closed due to the Port-Orford Cedar Root disease, but that we could drive into the Horse Linto Creek area and hike along the closed roads. We took that advice and spent the next five nights uneventfully.<BR><BR>We decided to return to Aikens Creek for the final night (Saturday, Nevember 22)  to take advantage of the open, flat space to dry wet equipment and see if we could observe anything further. We picked an open site midway between the foot of the hill and the highway, layed out equipment for drying, then decided to day-hike somewhere nearby. We drove up Bluff Creek Road to its closure at the road junction to Fish Lake then hiked 1.6 miles down that road.  I payed close attention to the steep clay roadsides, and once noticed what could have been a partial footprint of a large, humanlike foot from the heel (about 4\" in width) to a point about 6\" forward (and perceivably midway along the length of the foot. I found, however, no other footprints or enough context to draw any real conclusion about the impression.<BR><BR>That night, back at the campground, we kept a large campfire and kept some down and dead cedar boughs nearby to throw in for quick brightness if needed. At one point , my dog suddenly barked and charged towards the trees at the edge of the campground just  below the freeway. I halted him and went to investigate, but found nothing unusual. Though better prepared we neither saw nor heard anything further that night. We returned home however with a new awareness.",

He is a very experienced hunter and outdoorsman with a degree in wildlife biology and he had never heard anything like it. <BR><BR>Anyway, we were walking up the north bank, where the trails are, when I decided to cross to the south bank to check out some sandbars. I loaded up my girlfriend on my back and waded across. We then continued upstream a shortways when we came across three distinct footprints. <BR><BR>They were approximately 14 1/2 inches long. I measured them with a stick that I saved. I compared them with my own barefoot track for depth and they were nearly twice as deep. I weigh about 280 lbs. I was surprised that they weren''t wider, they were almost narrow for their length. I at first thought they were human because of this.  The best print had 5 very distinct toes and was flat, no arch at all, with toes straighter across than a normal human. It appeared that it had just leisurely walked into the creek. <BR><BR>I scoured up and down for an exit point but the terrain wasn''t suitable for tracks other than the odd sand bar. The strides were about 4 feet. It had come across a packed gravel bar leaving a few faint impressions. Nothing else observed.",

I found this trail that was going up the mountain, where their were large steps in the trail that were throwing my climbing stride off. At this point, this side of the mountain, that I was on, was bald and it was open ground with no trees or brush close by to hide behind.<BR><BR>Suddenly, I had this very bad feeling. Then the hair on the back of my neck stood up straight up!  I never had that happen to me before or since.  I believe this happened for no other reason except fear.  I then left this out of stride trail. Actually, I ran off the trail feeling terrified of something that was coming down this same trail.  I only got a short way off, when I went down on my knees and covered my face and eyes with both hands and tried to hide. At that moment I heard an animal on two legs come down the trail, a few yards from me, it stop and it had to gaze right at me for awhile, then it continued on down the hill.  I didn''t look until after it left and continued on down the mountain out of sight. So, I never saw this animal.  I believe this creature was directing a silent feeling toward me, and I complied.<BR><BR>At this point in my life, I had been a seasoned mountain man, and have had numerous encounters with many kinds of animals including bears and deer, day and night, but nothing like this. With no more fear I returned to the trail feeling fine. I thought of bigfoot right away. This time I paid close attention to detail.  There was no odor or smell, and the only odd thing was that the trail became fainter, as I continued to climb on up this mountain. I had expected this trail lead to somewhere, like a cave perhaps, but no, it just ended at a small meadow.  I looked all around, and I could see there was a lime stone ridge out-cropping in the distance, but no signs of a cave. <BR><BR>This encounter was really something to remember, and it was my experience. There isn''t any need for the so-called experts to tell me anything, they will just have to get they''re own experience. Besides, they''re just not in the loop.<BR>",
      "alsonoticed": "Unusual things, like that feeling of terror, no other sounds, or smells. Also, there were no tracks, because the ground was too hard. The trail was very old and it had been used a lot. One area had worn steps that were out of sync to my steps. I just had that bad feeling and the hairs on the back of my neck stood out. I have never had that before or since. This animal was not afraid or interested in me. I could find the trail again, but I will not divulge the location except by stringent interviewing.",

A young girl saw one cross road near dusk, and go into the dark woods. These people seemed honest about what they saw. While living in Takilma Oregon, in my cabin on the Illinois River, I heard a call sounding exactly like a great ape out of a zoo.

Our plan was to search the streambed for prints by day and listen and observe at night with 1st Gen. passive IR gear.<BR><BR>We conducted about 6 hours surveillance per night, with nothing noted.<BR><BR>Site #1: On second day (10? July) I was checking the north side of the streambed about 1/2 mile southeast of our campsite the (Wright Place) when I noticed a flat glade of trees on the south bank and walked across to investigate. After a few minutes in the glade I found a cedar tree with the top twisted off at the 7.5 to 8 foot level. Here the tree was about 2\" thick. Most alarming was that the break, and part of the tree where bark was stripped off, looked moist and fresh; probably occurring overnight, given the dry, and warm conditions. The top of the tree, with a few feet of stripped bark was at the tree''s base. No hairs found. I took pictures and brought the top back to my brother.<BR><BR>Later that day, at a second site (#2) about a mile northwest of our campsite, I found a 50 to70 meter, stretch with over 15 trees similarly broken off at between 4 and 8 feet off the ground. I took a few pictures of these. <BR><BR>Over the Labor Day weekend that same year (31 August to 2 September)<BR>my wife and I returned to the area. I thoroughly photographed and cataloged the trees at site #2.<BR><BR>We also drove a few miles north of #2, dropping down to the creek east off forest service road 13N01. There (#3) we found more tree breaks and a HUGE pile of dried feces; 2\"+ thick ropes with numerous undigested seeds and huckleberries. Most significantly it looked nothing like the abundant bear scat in the area, which was generally much less massive, purple/black and under 1\" thick.<BR><BR>Finally, as we were driving out of our campsite en route home, on forest service road 10NO6, we noticed by the side of the road (#4) a tree that looked like it had been violently twisted years earlier at the 9 to10 foot level and it continued to grow. We took a picture.<BR><BR><BR>NOTE: My interest in the Sasquatch started on the 7th of December 1979. I was a 12 yr. old passenger in my parent&#8217;s car, when we saw one.

Once we got to the lake we had our lunch and rested in our own way.  I decided to walk around the lake to take my mind off things.  About half way round the lake I spotted something strange in the water, up the lake embankment, and into the forest.  I called to the co-worker.  We saw Bigfoot tracks that lead from the water into the forest.  I ran back to the truck and got a measuring tape and ran back to the tracks.  The tracks measured 14\" long 5 1/2\" wide.  The distance between the tracks were 3''.  We wrote down the track details in our IDEA pads (pocket note books) and then left the area to finish our work day.

      "observed": " During the weekend of may 26th and 27th I was conducting a sound survey project with three other people near the town of Johnson and the Klamath River.   This area we were in had a sighting last year around the month of July.   <BR><BR>The place where we decided to set up was a recent clear-cut that ran along the hillside.   It was about 1000 feet wide and 1200 feet long.   On the edges were fir and oak trees that developed  a thick cover.   Running the width and centered in the clear-cut was a dirt road that the local people and loggers used on a daily basis.   It also provided us with a place to park and set up our sound equipment.   it also became base for our team.   <BR><BR>From our base, looking down into the valley about two miles we could see the town of Johnson.   From or point we were about 1500 feet above the river and town.   <BR><BR>Just prior to dusk, I had two members climb to the top of the clear-cut (about 150 feet in elevation and about 300 feet away from base).   I did this so if anything was to come closer to our base camp, they would have the best field of vision, and with their night vision device would be able to determine what it was.   We also had two way potable radios for the upper lookout and base.<BR><BR>Manny and myself continued to set up the equipment and waited until nightfall. <BR><BR>Because I was scheduled to participate at 10:00 PM in a live broadcast with Jeff Rense &#8220;Sightings&#8221; program, I was insuring that my bag cell phone was working properly.   All the equipment checked out other than the phone worked but had some static in the line.<BR><BR>At 9:40 we started to broadcast.   The sound traveled very well, and seemed to echo forever.   The location we were at easily helped the sound to travel well over five miles from valley to ridge top, and saddle, it covered a large area.   Very happy with the sound, we continued to broadcast a few more times before the Sightings show started.<BR><BR>It was almost 10:00 PM when the phone rang, it was the Sightings show.   The show went fine for the first few minutes, but the static was getting horrendous, cutting Jeff Rense off completely at times.   About ten minutes into this show, Jeff asked me to try and find another location where the reception might be a little better.   A commercial was playing at the time so I quickly contacted the upper team and Manny and told then that I had to move.   I started my vehicle and drove about 600 feet towards the tree line.  I reconnected to the show and was relived that it was a better connection.   <BR><BR>I was in this new location less than 15 feet to the tree line, with visibility not over 5 feet into the trees.   I was parked for a few minutes and heard what I thought was a bear charging me (I am in a convertible) with the window down, not much protection in anyone&#8217;s mind.     I looked for my revolver and it was gone, I must have forgot it with Manny when I was in a hurry to get into a better location!   I sat there for a second, and again I heard this charging, that sounded like a few feet away from me.   This time I started my car got on the radio and told the upper team that I was moving out because of something charging me in the bush.   (Manny didn&#8217;t have a radio, as we were together at base camp and had to share two, one for base and one for the upper team).<BR><BR>I asked the upper team &#8220;do you see anything&#8221; and they replayed no.   I decided to wait it out, as this thing could expose itself to me (although I just realized that my camera was also with Manny).<BR><BR>The show continued on and I would hear footfalls, breaking branches and at least one grunt growl.   I kept asking the upper team if they could see anything and they kept saying no.    I at least had a flashlight, but didn&#8217;t want to use it in fear that I would scare off whatever it was. <BR><BR>Obviously I was becoming very concerned for my safety, not knowing what it was.   But I remained there on a chance I might be able to see a Bigfoot or at least see something.   I heard the charging again and again and finally a crackle in the radio  &#8220;John it&#8217;s looking right at you, can&#8217;t you see it, it&#8217;s about 25 feet away, that ****** is huge&#8221;.   My heart started pounding FAST, and trying to carry on with this live program without sounding distracted was even harder.   <BR><BR>The other upper team member confirmed what they were looking at, it was something that was at least 8 feet tall with shoulders that were 4 feet across.   As I sat in my car, cell phone to one ear, and the other to the forest, I could hear it charge again, and that&#8217;s when they would say, &#8220;it went back into the trees&#8221;, this happened several times.  This sighting went on for several minutes, with the Squatch looking at me by moving its body from side to side trying to get a better look through the trees and brush.   It was also observed moving its arms in a quick motion as if signaling to others.<BR><BR>This whole incident from the first charge heard to the last tree branch breaking, lasted about 30 minutes.   It was by far the one of the most intense moments in my life.<BR><BR>That next day we did search the area and found the soil disturbed where this Squatch was spotted.  Due to the soil condition, it did not allow any prints to be left.   Judging from a tree and stump in the area, it was determined that it was at least eight feet tall but closer to nine feet.   From the Squatches point of view, it had several windows to look at me, and by moving its body from side to side it would have a clear view of my entire vehicle and me.<BR><BR><BR>You can listen to this event by going to sightings.com and clicking on archived shows.   Look for May 27th 2001.     The Bigfoot portion is the last hour of the show. <BR><BR> <BR>",

Somewhere past Trinidad and right before the lagoon we came around the corner on a four lane highway. Up ahead around 50 yards away a tall dark brown almost black \"man\" with long hair all over ran full stride across the highway. His arms hung long and the top of his neck seemed somewhat hunched over. The first thing that ran through my mind was \"What''s a man doing running across the road right here?\"  I thought this because we were completely out in the middle of no where.  Then I yelled, \"That was bigfoot!\" My boyfriend turned to me and said, \"shut up.  You''re playing with me.\"  I told him that he saw it with his own eyes.  By this time we had passed the point where he ran across the road into the forest, so we stopped and turned around.  We drove back to the point where he had re-entered the forest and stopped.  Peering into the thick forest it became too spooky for me and I drove off. I noticed where and when he chose to cross the road was very unique.  He waited until there were no cars except for ours which caught him off gaurd just comimg around the corner.  And where he crossed was flat.  It was the only place throughout the woods that didn''t have a little hill on either side of the highway.  Some of the people I have told of this ask if it was a bear, but there is no way it could have been at the speed he ran.",

      "observed": " John Freitas of BFRO was kind enough to allow us to borrow his broadcasting sound equipment for the duration of our camping trip. We broadcast the alleged Sasquatch \"screams\" and \"howls\" throughout the next few days, including the Bluff Creek Road areas.<BR><BR>Note: Before leaving the truck at the locked Forest Service gate, the Fish Lake Road, and hiking to Fish Lake, we broadcast two calls of each sound, the \"scream\" and the \"howl\". Coincidentally, our encounter occurred that same evening.<BR><BR>At approximately 9:30 p.m., we were in the process of setting up our second tent (there were six of us in the party), and maintaining the campfire when from directly across the road and meadow we heard a type of \"whistle\" or double \"whoop\" (try whistling these syllables \"WEEOOOU, WEEOOOU\") and it was immediately followed by a very intense \"screech\", which I could only compare to a bear cub in danger combined with the intensity of a hawk shriek. One of our younger members (15) insists it sounded like a possessed woman! <BR><BR>Now, I grew up in the mountains of Montana, am familiar with many animals and their sounds, and have never heard anything like this in my life. And until this moment, I have wondered what it was like to have the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I have never felt this kind of reaction, I repeat -- NEVER. <BR><BR>The sound sequence repeated itself again, followed by a third lone screech. Immediately, we panned the forest/tree line with our flashlights with the intent of at least seeing the reflection of an animal''s eyes. NOTHING. We must have lighted the area for nearly ten minutes following the sound and still saw nothing. As time wore on, we began to relax and go about our business of finishing the tent set-up and dinner. <BR><BR>Then at about 12:30 a.m. (just past midnight, with two of the teenagers already asleep), we again heard the \"whistle - whoop\" immediately followed by the \"screech\", but this time directly BEHIND our camp site up the slope near the picnic areas amongst the trees. Again, we panned the area with lights (I broke out the 2,000,000 candlepower gangbuster spotlight and lit the night ) and still, NOTHING. No movement, no eyes, nothing. After panning around the entire area once again, I noticed movement on the road towards the restrooms and we quickly moved the light in that direction. Walking across the road was a tiny little grey fox, or kit fox. Well, for our needs, that was our mystery animal. (We THOUGHT). We figured it yelped and then made that raucous screech for some other reason. Funny, but that was enough confirmation for us and we went to bed for the night.<BR><BR>At approximately 5:30 a.m., three of us woke at the same time and after a minute or two of silence we again heard the \"whistle - whoop\" followed immediately by the intense \"screech\" and this followed again by a lone \"screech\". But, this time the sound was only about 20 feet from our tent as if it was standing directly on the paved road next to our camp site. We were all unnerved somewhat, but agreed it''s just that darn kit fox again, and didn''t bother to jump out with the video cameras or spotlights. I exchanged words with a person in the other tent (not sure if this \"chased\" it away), but we then heard the same \"whistle\" and \"screech\" again, but far off in the distance as if it were a quarter-mile away. This was the end of our encounter.<BR><BR>The following morning we checked the area for any signs of tracks and found nothing. We also nearly walked the entire circumference of the lake shore searching for signs of any kind and [got] nothing. Please note that we did not HEAR any movement in the brush or any footsteps. We did not SEE any movement or eyes of any kind and we did not SMELL anything at all. After hiking out of Fish Lake the next day, and driving back to the coast, we just didn''t feel right with our \"kit fox\" explanation. It just didn''t sit right with us. The sound was just too intense. Then, upon discussing the incident with John Freitas that same evening, he agreed with the idea that foxes almost NEVER even make sounds, much less something as nerve-wracking as that of the night before. <BR><BR>On our trip back south, we stopped for a break and found a poster-type map discussing the numerous Bigfoot sightings and locations and in the accompanying paragraph it stated that \"... sounds associated with bigfoot encounters include whistles and shrieks similar to that of a mountain lion.\" We welcome your feedback on discussing these sounds.",

I gained a back and profile view before I could no longer overcome the intense fear I was experiencing.

      "observed": " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

Driving up the 101 we saw the ave of the giants scenic rout sign so not being in a hurry we took it headed north. Now I''m not sure ot the exact location but between two small towns maybe five miles north of where this gift shop that is actually carved out of a living redwood tree is (I hope that helps) there is a small parking lot off to the right where you can park and walk along some trails that I believe run parallel to the highway. I think the area is intended for day use only. well, we stopped and took a walk down this trail just to take in some of the scenery when about 200 yards down the trail my wife began to get this feeling something was off to the right. I told her it was her imagination when all of a sudden from that direction came this yell or howl that made my skin crawl. It!! started what seemed to be a good distance off in the thick forest and then moved rapidly closer. What startled me was the speed at which the source of the sound traveled. The howl itself sounded halfway between a human voice yelling \"Ahhhhhh\" and the high pitched sound of an elk. It wasn''t an elk or human or bear as near as I can tell though and what ever it was moved very fast. We didn''t see anything though but we got the distinct feeling weren''t welcome in the area. As it seemed to get to what seemed to be around 75 yards away we ran back to the car and promptly left. We never could figure it out so we just dropped the subject. My ex is a superstitious sort and at first started trying to explain it away as a ghost which me want to drop the subject even quicker. But the issue has always unsettled me and when I heard some of the recordings of bigfoot screams on this or some other b.f. website, one in particular was exactly like what I heard that day.

We were all sitting at the picnic table having lunch and was hearing much crashing in the brush. Not unusual sounds for there are elk everywhere in the park. We did notice however that a \"bear\" or something had an awfully good time with the outhouse toilet paper, as it was strung all over the place. We all were sitting there having lunch and I decided that I wanted to go see where the elk were, maybe see a big bull! So I got on my horse and rode down to where I heard the noise and the trail is cut out on an old logging road and a creek crosses through a culvert to the other side of the road and the water forms a small pool before moving on down into the larger creek below.<BR><BR>I could not tell you how long I was sitting there on my horse watching this creature not more than 30'' away trying to get a drink of water out of the pool. It was a challenge, as the sides to the pool were fairly steep. At first, I thought it was a man, then a monkey, and at last my brain registered what I was looking at! Then I seen the finger nail, and it was black and human like. I was looking at an adolescent, possibly baby Bigfoot! It never had a chance to turn and to look at me, as the horse I was on kept getting more and more upset the longer that I stayed there.<BR><BR>I ran back on my horse to my friends and told them in a stuttered manner what I had seen! Just by the way I was acting they knew something was up, because I have been in the woods on horseback almost half of my life. The immeadiately followed me back to the area where I had seen what I described as a young adolescent Bigfoot. My friends did not ever see the creature, but they heard it as it walked away and seen the ferns moving as it rustled through them on its way down the hill to the larger creek. Never heard any sounds from him/her. My friend was going to follow and I cautioned her, because I believe that \"Mom\" was close by. <BR><BR>The crashing in the brush we heard was not made by the adolescent looking creature, it was made by something much larger. The creature was silver-gray, had medium length hair (like a bear), black human like fingernails, human like hands (I seen its thumb), was totally covered in hair from top to bottom (I never got to see its face, it was always looking down).<BR><BR>I never have told anyone about the sighting and made my friends promise not to say anything for quite a while. I explained that this was a young animal and to allow me to get this close was inexperience. And if I could get that close on a horse, than someone could get that close with a gun! It was not long after that there was a news report about a son and a father seeing a Bigfoot cross the road near Prarie Creek State Park. The news report was within a couple of weeks of my sighting, but still I kept my sighting to myself!<BR>",

There was enough light to just make out that whatever it was, was moving on two legs. We found where it had gouged out the soft earth on the stream it crossed. No discernible footprints, but whatever made the gouge was big. We had to WAG (wild-ass-guess) at the length, over 19 inches. It was longer than the tip of my extended fingers to my elbow. The grass going across the meadow didn''t allow for footprints but was pressed down several hours later. We didn''t follow the trail towards the trees!!<BR><BR>It had been watching us for around 15 minutes, give or take 5. I was asleep when my friend woke me up. Said he heard something moving above us on the exposed rock above our camp. He had his 9mm (personal protection from the typical axe-murderer you meet while camping) in hand and was a little wound up. We listened to it move around with the occasional skip like someone was jumping a short distance to another rock. It moved behind us then down into the meadow that surrounded the stream we were camping on. We saw it cross the stream and slip as it went across on the other side. It moved across the meadow at a quartering angle away from us and into the tree-line. <BR><BR>We know it wasn''t a bear. We had several run-ins with bears trying to get our food cache at night in Yosemite. Thought we would get away from the crowds on this backpacking trip. Good call, huh? Once we calmed down we discussed what we think we saw, we both came to the same conclusion. I know we didn''t halucinate. Our eyes had time to adjust before we finally got a visual of it moving across the meadow. We stayed awake until we had enough light to look the area over quickly and then beat feet out of there.",

      "observed": " A friend and I went driving to camp in Oregon on Hwy. 199 in the Fall of 1985. We didn''t want to stay at a pay site so we pulled off on a side spur road in dense forest and set up a tent. We had our two Malamute-cross dogs with us who had been by our sides in many back-country adventures.<BR><BR>As we set up our sleeping bags in the tent the dogs began growling very menacingly with the hair up full on their backs. We thought there might have been a bear around and worried that they would take off after it and be difficult to catch. We left them outside anyway and crawled into our bags to sleep.<BR><BR>Then the dogs began whimpering and trying to claw their way into the tent. We nervously let them in and not long afterwards began to hear howling; first just one voice but then followed by many voices. I would estimate that the sounds came from about 100 yards away. It was reminiscent of hearing a coyote pack or wolf pack but these were not canine voices. They ranged in pitch from \"childlike\" to adult male and higher female voices. It sounded like a really loud frat party in the middle of nowhere on a stormy blustery night in the dark. It sounded like the people were talking very loud yet howling at the same time. I''ve had many experiences hearing coyote packs and this was not what I heard. I have no further explanation.<BR><BR>We braved through the night and got the heck out of there in the morning.<BR><BR>The second \"experience\" I had at Avenue of the Giants was with the same friend while we were hiking a trail there. It was again the Fall of 1985 about a month later than the first. We had a map with us and decided to cut a loop short by going cross-country through the dense redwood forest. Not long after we got started, the dog we had with us (same as one of the dogs previous) lunged out full on his leash and began dragging my friend up a steep incline. We reached the top and noticed large foot-shaped impressions (maybe 14-18 inches long and 8-10 inches wide) in the duff below. Above us on the length of ground the dog drug us through, branches were snapped off clean up to 10 feet high on the trees. We made our way back to the main trail with no further incident.",
      "alsonoticed": "The most striking thing was the odd behaviour of the dog(s). Anyone who has owned a Malamute knows they are very bold dogs that basically aren''t afraid of anything, especially when there''s more than one. When the dogs (near Oregon) tried to claw their way into the tent, it sent shivers up my spine and I must say I didn''t get much sleep that night. Again, with the incident at Richardson Grove, the dog actually stood up on its hindlegs and \"walked\" while lunging forward up a steep bank dragging my friend who weighed about 170 lbs with it in its pursuit of the thing that left big footprints. Never had that dog done that before or since in spite of many wilderness adventures, bear, elk, deer, etc. encounters.",

      "observed": " There was about 10 of us watching the Perseids meteor shower from a clearing near an area where we were building a small cabin. Previously that summer we had heard some moanings or low growlings up on the top edge of the property coming from the uncut Bureau of Land Management forest, but did not think much of it.<BR><BR>Everybody else got tired of watching the meteor shower (it was spectacular!!!) and went back to the cabin site. I was alone laying on my back in a clearing about 100 yards from camp at about midnight, looking up at the stars and admiring the shower when I had the feeling of another presence. This seems to be a common phrase in these situations but I have to say that this feeling of being watched is something I never felt before or after. Makes you wonder about some sort of a higher lever of consciousness or something similiar (dare I say telepathic?).<BR><BR>I got up and cut over to a logging road that went back to camp and was about 20 yards from camp when I heard a rustling off to my right just a few feet away in dense brush. I did not even look to see what it was. I just sprinted the rest of the way back to camp and did not say anything. We were having a good time listening to loud rock and roll music (car stereo with trunk open) and drinking beer when a friend of mine said to me, \"Do you smell that ... what is it??\"<BR><BR>Well ... I had been noticing this odor but had not said anything. It smelled like a cross between an oil refinery (very sulfurish) and had an animal musk smell to it and was VERY VERY strong. I recognized the animal muskiness from my trapping days as a youth, so I told my friend, \"This is an animal.\" My friend said it smelled like diesel fuel and put out his cigarette it smelled so strong. This smell was so strong that it seemed that it had to be right in front of your face. We figured it was coming from a particular stand of trees and decided to walk up and behind this stand to see if we could still smell it.<BR><BR>When we got behind the stand we couldn''t smell it but when we got back around down-wind of the stand we heard something take off downhill and down-wind of us. All we saw was swaying brush where it had gone crashing down the mountain side. Some of the guys wanted to chase it but I convinced them that since it had left that we should leave it alone if it left us alone. Well ... in 15 minutes the smell was back. This time everybody in camp grabbed a gun ... we had a lot of guns and decided to chase this smelly thing down. Except for me and 2 others. I just had a flashlight. Well ... they chased this thing out of the aforementioned stand of trees and could hear it and smell it but could not see it. We could hear it stomping and thrashing around behind the stand of trees. They chased it up a narrow trail that led to a spring.<BR><BR>I was bringing up the rear but only had the flashlight so I went back to camp with the other 2 that had remained. We could hear the \"hunting party\" about 50 or 60 yards up this narrow difficult trail yelling \"He''s right up here ... there he is!!!!\" Then the yelling stopped for a few seconds then they started screaming. They came running out of the forest single file screaming in fear. They said the could hear and smell what they were chasing but could not see it and then suddenly there was no sound or smell. At this point they decided that whatever it was had stepped off of the trail and they had run right by it. Well this freaked them out and explains their hasty retreat.<BR><BR>It was quiet the rest of the night but a couple of mornings later 2 of the guys were sleeping in a 2-man tent on a hillside above the camp and woke the rest of us at first light, yelling. When we got to the tent we found a huge turd about 18 inches from the front of the tent opening. It was about 4-inches in diameter and about 20 inches long and appeared to be mostly leafy material with some berry seeds. I guess that was his notice to us that he did not appreciate our company!!!<BR><BR>It was uneventful for the rest of the summer.",
      "alsonoticed": "Heard some moaning growling sounds up in the forest prior. One account I have read described it as a Howler Monkey sound and I agree. I would like to touch on the sense of being watched. I feel certain that there was some sort of extra sensory faculty at work here. I was in a meditative state while alone on the hill side and was in a \"pure consciousness\" state. A state where there is no thought but just being(awarness). I was in the process of expanding my field of consciouness when I felt the other presence. I feel that this may have been a factor in this episode. Like maybe it was drawn to this awareness. Also ... I never felt fear even for a moment. I have read many other accounts and know that this sense is common with this experience. I do not claim to be psychic or have ESP.",

      "observed": " I have reported this incident before. Perhaps it was not close enough to a sighting to publish on your site. I originally said that the incident occurred at Mcgee Creek. I was incorrect. It was Deadman''s Creek. It was Summer. I believe the year was 1970. I was 12 years old or so. My friend and I belonged to the Western Conservation Club and went on many outings with the group. We would work at an area (cleaning it up and restoration) half our stay and play the other half.<BR><BR>My friend and I decided that we were going to walk way up the creek to go fishing. More to get away from the adults than anything else. It was mid-afternoon when we started out. The area had very few trails, once you left the immediate camping area. We headed out cross-country staying as close to the creek as possible looking for good fishing holes. We had walked about five miles up the creek towards the mountains when we both got the feeling that we were being watched. We both looked at each other and called each other light-weights and kept on going.<BR><BR>We fished for awhile, by now it was late afternoon. We noticed that there were none of the usual sounds that you hear in a forest such as birds, etc. We still had that feeling of being watched. The sky was starting to look threatening as an afternoon storm was heading down the canyon / creek towards us.<BR><BR>We started back to camp when the storm caught us and lightning started. A bolt of lightning struck the ground on the other side of the creek and up a ways from our location. Directly afterwards, we heard a growling or grunting sound from the area of the strike. We heard the sound of branches breaking in the brush. The sound was moving up the creek away from us and up the mountain. The breaking branches sounded as if they were high up in the trees. The trees in the area are conifers and the dead branches started about six or more feet up the trees from ground level -- so whatever was breaking the branches, it had to be pretty tall.<BR><BR>The object was moving fast because it was soon out of hearing distance. You know as well as I that sound travels a long way in the woods and we were in a canyon so the object was really moving. We never noticed a foul odor or saw anything conclusive. I did, however, see a large shadow moving through the woods briefly.<BR><BR>Please understand that although we were very young we had a lot of experience in the back country. We knew what the indigenous animals looked like, their habits and the sounds that they make. This growling did not sound like anything that I ever heard before or since. I know that this will sound funny but a person knows when things are not quite right and this was not right. Just a feeling.<BR><BR>We could not return to the area to look for footprints as the lightning strike caused a fire and the camp site was evacuated by the USFS. At the time I had heard about bigfoot, but only up north. I was unaware of local sightings until recently. This thing was not a bear. I thought that at the time. I tried to make it a bear so I could put the incident out of mind, but it just doesn''t add up that it was a bear unless this bear was huge, walking erect and hauling ass. It also did not sound like any bear noises that I''ve ever heard, not that I am a bear expert or anything.",

Then you must walk up the bar of Tek-Tah Creek about 1/2 miles or so to a place where the creek canyon curves to the east and the creek itself flowed against a steep curved cliff or hillside. The cliff was about 150 yards long and perhaps 50-100'' high. the creek flowed against this cliff and formed a deep (maybe 6-7'') arched pool about 100 yards or so long. On the eastern side of the creek was a large bar made of fine dry sand and some gravel. This bar was as long as the pool, and was maybe 50yards wide at its largest spot. The creek was flanked on bothe sides by steep and desnse timber and brush. There may have been some debrees on the bar, but I can''t remember (It is strange what you can and cannot remember after so many years...). At the northern end of this bar is where I saw the tracks.",

      "observed": " I grew up in the woods of the Pacific Northwest.  My father also grew up there. He was born in Klamath Falls, Oregon, but grew up in the eastern SF Bay Area.  He has a BS in Forestry, A Masters in Zoology, and A PHD in Entomology, and worked as a research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service.  For most of his 20-30 years of service, my father did research on insects that predate timber harvest species in California and Oregon.  When he did his research (usually in the summer and fall) my younger brother and I would accompany him into the woods.  My father was and is a great woodsman, a hunter and fisherman, who taught my brother and myself all about the forests and what types of plants and animals lived there.  My father was also a man of science and this is important to note as will become evident later.<BR><BR>At the end of each summer season, my family and some other forestry families would get together and take several weeks of vacation.  Most often, we would load canoes and float down the lower 15-30 miles of the Klamath River to its mouth.  My father and I would fly fish for steelhead in the riffles during mornings and evenings and we would spend the hot hours of the day canoeing, exploring, resting, etc. These trips would often take one to two weeks to complete.  During one of these trips (probably in 1969 or 1970, I was about 8-9 years old I think...) we made camp on the river bar at the mouth of Tek-Tah creek.  There was a good flat bar there, and at that time of year, the creek was flowing under the sand and apeared dry. One afternoon, while everyone else was napping, my father and I took a walk up the creek bed to see if the creek was flowing on the surface somewhere inland.  About two hundred yards upsteream, the creek did come to the surface and flowed sluggishly thruogh a series of large pools. I remember my dad telling me that these pools were probably full of baby salmon and steelhead waitng for fall rains to allow them to swim down to the main river and out to sea.  My dad had a very scientific mind and he would describe natural processes in great detail when we had the patience to listen.<BR><BR>As we proceeded inland up the creek, we rounded a bend and entered a long, sandy bar on the east side of a long arching pool in the creek. As I looked across the surface of this bar, I saw a set of tracks in the soft sand. These tracks caught my attention because they were very large, and the space between them seemed very long, like if I laid down next to them, they would almost be further apart than the legth of my body.  The tracks also seemed to sink alot deeper into the sand than the footprints of my dad, who is pretty big (6'',2\"). The tracks began at the water''s edge at the lower end of the bar, and proceeded diagonally across the bar in a straight line to the far end of the bar.  <BR><BR>My father had never told me any stories about bigfoot  (he would deny the existence of any animal that was \"unknown\" until science recognized it anyhow) and to my knowledge, I had not heard of any such animal at that time, nor had I any thing more than a passing interest in these types of things then, but these tracks...thier size, gait, and the way they led across the bar in a strieght line...they made a funny impression on me.  My father was also very interested in the tracks, he asked me please not to walk near or in them, then asked me to sit down while he spent several minutes comparing his foot size to them, and trying to match thier spacing by walking next to them.  He seemed very tense, as if he sensed something, or was trying to figure something out.  Eventually, I got bored of sitting and got up and followed him. When I finally caught up with him, we were half-way up the bar.  He had stopped looking at the tracks and was instead looking intently at the timber ahead and at the southern edge of the bar.  He was very quiet and tense.  I have never seen my father frightened or worried about anything before, or since for that matter, but watching him the way he scanned the surrounding forest so intently, made me very nervous and excited.  I broke the silence and began to ask him what he thought made the tracks and what was he trying to see in the trees...He turned around, almost jumping a little in suprise, and told me to be quiet.  then he looked around some more, and started back towards the camp with a qick pace, grabbing me by the hand, and saying these are the tracks of a big bear, son, and we should leave this area alone from now on.  Then he told me not to come up the creek alone, and not to tell Mama or my brother or any of the others anything about what we saw, that it might worry them or something, and that he would speak no more of this matter.  Just like that!  <BR><BR>Well the older I get the funnier that incident and those tracks seem to me. I have hunted for many years and have seen and tracked many animals in the woods since that time, and have never seen anything like that since.  I am thirty eight now, and my father has retired. I asked my father about this incident last year, and he was silent and pensive for a long time, then he told me that he does''nt remember this time or seeing anything other than bear tracks. I don''t know what we really saw that day, but I do know that it scared my dad, and he has never ever spoken to me the way he did on that day, or behaved that way since.    ",

One night (the last one) we were all camping for the weekend in this old place that we had fixed up.  After cooking the evening meal, we had all eaten and went to bed.  Sometime during the night I was awakened by a huffing sound.  I woke one of the other boys up and we listened to something slowly working its way all around the outside of the cabin.  We woke up the three others and all listened.  Whatever it was outside was poking at the old rotted boards around the bottom of the shack.  We could hear it shuffle around and pry at some of the boards.  Finally it moved around to the front door, which was only about five feet high and Butch got my old .22 rifle and said, \"Open the door!\"  I did not want to open the door but did anyway.  Whatever it was, was standing right in front of the opening but because it was dark, all we could see were hairy legs.  Butch fired the .22 and this thing screamed and spun around and took off.  Needless to say we were scared to death.  We heard two or three heavy thuds and then everything was quiet.  We tried to sleep but ended up huddled up together in the middle of the floor the rest of the night.  The next morning we went out as a group and searched the ground.  There was a tore up place where this thing spun around and about three or four indentations in the ground where it took off.  There was no blood on the ground anywhere.  We packed up and never went back.",

That would of put it at 62 thru 64. I was below our house and used to go down to the spring and just hang out out. I got halfway down and looked across and there was this big ape in my mind looking at me. It is still so clear that moment. I do know that I left first and I never said a word to anyone what I saw. Our house burned down in 67 or 68 and we moved to Eureka. When my sister and I became adults I told her what I saw that day and she started crying she had experined the same thing only she was down at the spring and he was above her on the log. I moved back to the home place the spring of 1972 and everything was fine. I lived there with my son and at that time whoever needed a place. That Fall everyone pretty much left and as the nightly custom I would build a fire and my son and I would sit around it and eat. We had no electricity or anything. That hillside always rang with birdsong  never a quiet moment. That night there was silence and a wierd feeling came over me like eyes were watching . I grabbed my son and a few clothes and we hiked down to the nearest house. I never went back there to live it scared me that bad. There is alot more stories I could tell you about this mountain but I will leave that for later. I know what I saw that day and I know the feelings that I had years later. I would like to say that this was 40 acres that I grew up on and always felt safe after that night I left I never got that feeling back again something changed.

I was far ahead of my friends and decided to scare them as they came up the trail so I climbed up some rock cliffs for a better advantage and settled down within some Huckleberry bushes to wait for my friends.  After things quieted down I noticed a heavy smell and started looking around.  The breeze was blowing straight from the brush behind me and I felt the hair on my neck starting to rise up. My two friend were nowhere in sight.  I noticed a small movement in the berry bushes right behind me.  I stood up ready to run when this thing stood up also.  It didn''t hesitate but turned and walked off into the brush.  I heard trees snapping and the crunch of dry leaves echo away as I ran back to my friends who were still two hundred yards away.  After I calmed down we went back to the spot to look for some sign.  They believed I saw a bear but I know what I saw.  We found where something was squatted down and stripping berries.  I had disturbed its meal.  Small trees were just broken off about 4 feet from the ground as the thing made its retreat.",

      "observed": " This incident happened 41 years ago when I was 19 years old. My friend and I were bear hunting up in Humboldt County on the Hoopa Indian Reservation. It was in March or April. Back then bear hunting was open all year long in Humboldt County, and there were no limits. We were from Southern California, and were totally unfamiliar with the area. We stopped in a town on the Trinity river, I believe the name of the town may have been Willow Creek, I''m not sure. Anyway we met some Indians in town, and asked them, if they knew of any good places to hunt bear. They said they didn''t, but added, that there was an old man in the grocery store who may be able to help us. The Indians pointed to an old blue 1950 Buick parked in front of the store, and told us that the car belonged to the old man, so we waited there until he came out. When he came back to his car, we introduced ourselves, and asked him if he knew of any good places to hunt bear. He told us it was pretty good up on the Hoopa Reservation, and gave us some general directions. We ended up on an old deserted dirt road high in the mountains in my friends dads 1949 (4) door Chevy. We kept going up until we hit snow, started to fishtail, and the right rear wheel went over the side. We set the hand brake and got out of the car to evaluate the situation. We decided to get the bumper jack out of the trunk, and jack the car up, and then push it off of the jack back on the road. The plan worked and all 4 wheels were back on the road. We backed down the road until we came to a place where we could turn around. By now it was dusk, and we decided we had better pitch our tent before it got too dark. At the turn around spot next to the road we saw a big pine tree and decided to set up camp under the tree. By the time we pitched the (4) man umbrella tent it was dark. We put all of our sleeping gear and firearms in the tent and lied down, and were talking for about ten minutes, when we heard the first grunt outside the tent. We both pretended that we didn''t hear anything and kept talking. Then it did it again, and this time we both stopped, and I asked my friend if he heard that. He said he did, and also heard it the first time. I said yeah, me too. Now, we both shut up and listened. We could hear it circling the tent, because the ground was covered with bark, and we could hear the bark crunching under its feet. We could also hear its very loud breathing. By the sound of its footsteps and its breathing, we figured whatever this was, it was huge and it was walking on (2) feet. It circled the tent several times, and we decided that one of us should go out and see what it was. Niether of us wanted to go out, because we were scared, so we decided to flip a coin to see which one of us would go. My friend lost. I then suggested that before he went out, it may be wise, to fire the 44 mag out of the tent flap first. He concurred, and stuck the barrel out of the flap and fired 5 shots. We then both went out, he had the 44, and I held the light. We looked all over and didn''t see a thing. We went back in the tent, laid down, and were  trying to figure out what had just been outside of the tent. We had never heard of sasquatch. We had been talking for about 5 or 10 minutes when we heard a very loud high pitched scream, that lasted for about 5 seconds, and sounded like it was about 50 to 100 yards away. We looked at each other and asked, what the heck was that? That was one heck of a scream. We talked a little longer and then went to sleep. The rest of the night was un-eventful. We arose the next morning and went outside, and looked around the circumference of the tent for footprints. We couldn''t see any, because the ground was covered, with many years accumulation of bark from the huge pine tree we were camped under. We had wondered many times, what it was, that had been outside our tent that night and often talked about it. Then one day several years later, I happened to be in the barber shop, getting a haircut. I picked up an Argosy magazine, and it had the now famous controversial picture of the female sasquatch on the cover. I read the article, and in the article there was a map with an X on it. The X indicated where the picture was supposedly taken. The X on the map wasn''t far from where we were camped that night. That''s when I made the connection and since then after reading about many encounters I am pretty well convinced that the animal that we had heard outside of our tent 41 years ago was a sasquatch.",

We began to run back down the road and the creature kept pace with us although we knew due to the size it could easely go faster. it stayed in the brush and trees and when it would get ahead of us, it would stop and watch us but never came across the road just followed and watched from across the road. When we reached the center of clearing on Hanson''s property we stopped and looked back.  It was no longer there.  About two years ago I asked my brother if he remembered the incident, thinking it was something I had just imagened, and he said, just as wided eyed as that day, yes it was real.

The road was a two lane highway (opposite directions) with a soft dirt shoulder. We were in an open convertible (because the skis did not fit otherwise). <BR><BR>The moon was full and the lighting was un-obscured and visibility was (near daylight) excellent. In the distance (well beyond the reach of the High beamed head lights) two of us could see a very large and (completely out of place) thing running ahead of our approaching car. It was on the other side of the road. We slowed, 50, 40,30mph... now in our headlights. Running on the dirt shoulder, obviously unaware of our approaching auto... There it was \"Bigfoot\"! At its closest point we were 10 UNOBSTRUCTED FEET FROM IT! EYE TO EYE!<BR>",
      "alsonoticed": "Perhaps, the most \"burnt in\" recollection of the sighting was the look of absolute surprise on the creature...We were close enough to SEE (and almost SENSE how very startled it was by us being suddenly eye-to-eye with us. This was not some lower animal response. This was an intelligent human like, ''Oh crap- you saw me and where did you come from'' look of surprise, as it stared at us just prior to running down and off the elevated highway.The creature was SIGNIFICANTLY larger than even the largest of human beings (NO WAY THIS WAS A HUMAN BEING DRESSED IN COSTUME AS \"BIGFOOT\"). While, we were sitting in an auto, I can still say, with a high degree of accuracy, that the creature was eight to nine feet tall. The body mass was stout, thick in the chest/trunk, and very muscular. Even though 90% hair covered, you could see outline of significant \"muscle definition and mass\". This is much better than a guess; it weighed upwards of 500-600 lbs. I can remember many details of creature: hair 90%, dirty skin tone, where there was leathery skin 10%, arm length, relative appendage size, and the biometrics of the approximate 15 mph running gate...Even the highly expression (because of the surprise) on its eyes... The other witness, I am quite certain, will have an equally vivid recollection.",

      "timeandconditions": "A full moon, cold and absolutely clear, and the time of night was between 8 & 9:00pm. The light of the intense full moon gave the crispness and brightness of \"twilight\". We had excellent visual clarity of the surrounding environment and the actual ''creature'' less than a dozen feet away. Additionally, the headlights of the auto added lighting. However, my recollection is such that the ambient lighting from the moon was (if you assigned light character) perhaps 75%, and the remaining acuity of 25%, from the headlights. It was quite nearly like a full daylight sighting.",

The following morning we started fishing with no luck, and the mosquitos were eating us alive, so I decide to go back down to the local McDonalds. That afternoon we did alright by catch a few decent size trout.   Mistakenly, I clean the fish at our campsite. I put them away in an ice chest as proof we did have some luck.<BR>We went to bed proud of our catch and tired from the sun and the lack of oxygen due to the high altitude [9350 feet]. Needless to say we all fell asleep fast. <BR><BR>I dont know if the dead silence, or if the heavy footsteps woke me up. But I knew someone or something stopped just outside our tent. My nephew asked what is it. I quickly hushed him. I stood up and was able to peek outside to see if it was a bear.<BR><BR>Id like to mention before I continue that Ive had run in bears and mountain lions.  I worked around then with great caution and a bit scared of what may happen if they attack. Fortunately, I never had the feeling that I was in a life or death situation.  What I saw that night made feel I had to leave the mountain as soon as it was safe.<BR>The angle I had only allowed me to see the legs. The legs were muscular and human like. Its buttocks would have been at my mid abdomen. I am 56.  Yes, Im short but this was Shaquille ONeil level.  Hairy, muscular legs, and just huge. <BR><BR>Ive been afraid before but never paranoid.  I was frozen and shocked. I shined my flashlight on its legs very briefly through the tent mesh then I turned the light away, pointing it at my chest. It stood there for about a minute or two, but it felt like 5 minutes.  It moved on and I listen for a while. As soon as I felt it was safe, I packed my nephew and son into my car. I grab our bags and some other stuff but the fear was over whelming.  I left the tent and some other camping gear.   <BR><BR>We made our way home two days early. My son never realized what happened, only to wake up at home Tuesday morning.  Everyone was asking why we were home early.  I never said why, other than that the kids were getting board.   My nephew brought it up 10 years later, and when I told them, I was mocked. So I kept it to myself. <BR>",

When I was 10 years old, my father decided I was strong enough for a long excursion in the wilderness, and we set off for a place called Seven Lakes near Big Pine. We had hiked for a few days when we came to the sixth lake, and we could see the seventh lake just beyond it. Seventh lake was covered with ice and there was snow all around just past where we decided to camp for the night. <BR><BR>We thought this would be a good place to stay and explore the next day. During the night a snow storm hit and it became freezing cold, so my father and I put our sleeping bags over us and huddled together for warmth. I kept looking at my father''s watch and hitting the light on it to see when we could expect the sun to rise so we could get warm. It was 3:45 a.m when we heard footsteps walking up the trail towards us. Our tent was right on the edge of the trail, and whatever was out there walking was on two feet and very big, we could almost feel the ground shake as it got closer. My father and I looked at eachother in silence, both of us a bit shocked by what we were hearing. It walked right up to our tent and stood there for about five minutes, completely silent.<BR><BR>I have very good senses and I could feel that whatever it was absolutely didn''t want us there. I could feel its anger resonating, I can''t explain how, but I got the most scary feeling in my heart. It wanted us to leave. Then it walked off just as suddenly as it came, but it headed in the direction of the frozen lake, and beyond that the trail went into very rugged wilderness. I didn''t think it was a person because it had no flashlight, was very large, and only an idiot would continue walking on the trail into the wilderness at that time of night, in the middle of a snowstorm.<BR><BR>My father and I were quite frightened by our nightime visitor, and when first light hit we instantly broke camp and headed down the mountain without making breakfast, nor saying a word to eachother. We both knew we had to get out of there. Unfortunately, we were so far in the wilderness that we had to camp again that night further down the mountain, but this time we were not visited luckily.<BR><BR>My father has a MBA and is a successful businessman, very well liked and trusted in his community. To this day we still talk about the incident from time-to-time, and we still don''t know what it was. At the time the incident happened, I was so scared I didn''t even think to look for tracks, and I don''t think I wanted to. We didn''t notice a smell, but the direction of the wind was going from us towards the creature and I think that may be why we didn''t smell it. We never actually saw it, but it sure didn''t seem to be a man.",

      "observed": " I do not know whom to contact but I have a story to tell. My name is J. C. and I am a 41 year old Vice President of a bank. I have been harboring an encounter I had for 31 years secretly out of fear of ridicule or shame. But now that I have seen other people have had similar situations, I must tell my story. During September 1972, I was hiking down from a lake with my dad and my friend on a fishing trip. We were at a place called Barney Lake out of Mammoth, California, and were on our way home. After a weekend of camping and fishing we were backpacking out from the lake. I was the lead person going down the trail. I had outpaced my friend J. C. and my dad by about 4 minutes without knowing it as I was moving quickly down the trail. After about 10 to 40 minutes down the trail from Barney Lake (I can''t remember exactly after all these years) I came into a clearing. It was a small flat grassy meadow from the trees which I had been seeing downhill till then. I took a break to rest from my fast strides and looked out over the meadow. The first thing I saw was a big white rock boulder near the end of the meadow. The meadow was maybe 20 yards by 30 yards of grass. At the point of the clearing to my left I heard extreme thrashing going on. I looked over to my left to see a large animal bent over with its rear end facing me. It was only about 12 feet away from me. I saw that it was hairy and had a reddish, orange, brown multicolor mix hair to it, and most different was a rear end that was bare like a monkey''s. I knew this because at this time in my life I spent most of my lunch hours in the library reading zoology and marine biology books. I thought this was very strange because no bear could bend over at the waist and have skin over its rear end like this. In my fear I was frozen, shocked and bewildered at the same time. I had never known or heard of big foot or sasquatch at this time in my life. At this point it had been maybe 5 or 6 seconds and then the animal lifted up and stood erect. It was enormous. It must have been 8 feet tall or more, and for a 10 year old boy this was unreal. It had been scratching with its hands and grubbing and digging prior to looking for what I thought was food. Its back was to me when it stood so I could see it was built similar to a human but with a lot of hair. I knew this was no bear from my background. I also knew only black bear were seen as an almost extinct species here during this time, and would have been much smaller in height and stature. I got so scared I ran full pack towards that big white rock. I literally dove over the top, pack and all, and snuggled against the rock, so scared to even look, in case the creature heard me. Finally after about 20 seconds or so, I peeked over the rock to see nothing and no one on the trail. Within 1 or 2 minutes, my dad and John came down the trail and into the opening. I started screaming at them \"look out, look out,\" in fear that the creature was still there and would do something to them. They froze,  bewildered, looked left to where I was pointing and then back to me in confusion. They were standing at the clearing at the spot I had been at. I finally came out and walked to them and looked into the trees and thick brush only to see broken brush, twigs and some hair there. We moved on finally and I never spoke of this again except to my dad and a couple of close friends. Around 7 or 8 years late I saw a couple of bigfoot movies including the Patterson video. Once I saw this, I knew without a doubt this was what I saw. I still kept my story a secret out of fear, but this vision haunts me and will all my life. I know it was so real. I will never forget this and take it to my grave. I am now someone who needs answers and must try and find out that this creature does exist or I will not put my memory to rest. I know what I saw was no figment of my imagination or hoax. I want to seek it out. Anyway, I hope this eye witness helps some where some how.",

She has lived and in this area since 1980.

At Weldon meadow we stopped for lunch and this was are next area to work.  During lunch, the co-worker went to do a little exploring.  After about 10 minutes the co-worker yelled to me to come and see and ID some wildlife tracks.  These were not wildlife tracks.  We saw what looked something like a human foot track but, it was way to big with a slight distortion in the toes.  The tracks measured about 16 inches long and 7 inches wide.  The tracks looked like the ones I saw last year at the Six Rivers National Forest.  I snapped a picture of the track and looked to see wher the tracks were going.  The tracks followed the barbed wire fence.  The meadow area is used for cattle grazing.  The co-worker asked me what it meant.  I said, \"It''s possible that Bigfoot was looking for food or was heading for the spring at the end of the fence.\"  We then proceeded to do are work so that we could finish this area and head for the other area.  We finished and headed towards the Woolstaff Meadow Area.  Once down there we proceeded to do are job.  While working on the project, I spotted the same tracks that we saw earlier.  The tracks cut across the trail and headed towards some rock outcroppings.  This was enough to spook my co-worker and so we left the area.

After we barbequed we found it difficult to move about the campsite because of the huge rocks everywhere. I actually slipped and banged my knee on one of those boulders. I was in a small tent and my son Ron slept in the Ford Tempo.  He is a sound sleeper.  I am not.  During the night he awoke me and said something was moving around in the blackness outside his car.  I told him to go back to sleep and it was cold so I bundled up and tried to sleep despite the pain from my banged knee.  Right as the sun came up I heard the loudest scream right outside my tent.   It was inhuman - much louder than a man''s voice and of an alarming intensity and pitch.  I unflapped one of the tent windows and looked out, expecting to see I knew not what.

What the Hell is THAT?!!\" At my yell,the thing looked up at me. <BR>  It had been standing sideways from my view,and cocked it''s head up and to the rear on it''s right side.I could see it had a face,not too unlike a human. Then it took off thru the brush,before my friend got within ten feet of the ledge. He did not see a thing!

      "observed": " I was hunting with my close friend Chris R. in Sonoma County, CA on our family property that is adjacent to Pine Mountain.  We were walking along an old camp road that had become overgrown with brush and scrub.  <BR><BR>It was obvious that bear had been using this trail as there was a considerable amount of bear sign along the old road.  We got to a point in the trail where there was an overhang of pine limbs over a slight depression on the right side of the old road.  Upon inspecting the depression we noticed what appeared to be a left foot print, and a right leg outstretched in the pine needle cover on the ground.  We continued to survey the area, and noticed what appeared to be more tracks leading away from this overhang and depression.  I took photos with a disposable camera.  I have the prints, but they did not come out very clear.  Which was a disappointment, but something to look at nonetheless.  <BR><BR>We finished poking around, and continued on our way.  We got just a bit further down the trail, and we walked through an extremely strong smell of skunk, or wet dog-like odor.  No sooner had you smelled it that is disappeared, but if you took a few steps back it was extremely strong again.<BR><BR>I have been hunting and recreating outdoors for many years, and I am very familiar with skunk spray, and how it seems to permeate a large area.  This was not simply the spray of a skunk.  It was very centralized.  It was literally like you walked through it, and it disappeared, then you could turn around and walk through it again.  <BR><BR>The two of us spent a few moments looking around, and we noticed, something very peculiar.  In the middle of the trail and not far from this smell, and the foot prints we had seen, was a large pile of oak acorns.  The strange thing was there was not an oak anywhere near this pile of acorns!  They seemed to have been placed in this location.  They were not a collection of shells from squirrels, they were fresh dropped acorns.  Enough to hold a hungry deer, or two for a little while.<BR><BR>We theorized that whatever had been hunkered down under the pine overhang in the depression may have placed these acorns, then set up under the overhang off of the trail in ambush.<BR><BR>Our intent was to walk to the back of Pine Mountain, then still hunt our way up to the top of the mountain.  We had used this road for years to access the back of the mountain, and we were very used to the topography, so anything out of the norm would be noticeable to us.  <BR><BR>Chris and I team hunt very well together and after a short strategy chat, decided to use a 50 step method: one of us would go 50 steps, stop and whistle to let the other hunter know it was their turn to take 50 steps, and then just watch and listen.  We were approximately 130 yards apart.<BR><BR>The ground was covered in heavy and dry leaf litter so the going was somewhat noisy.  I had gone nearly three quarters of the way to the saddle at the top, and I heard what sounded like a whistle, but not the whistle I recognized as Chris''.  I also heard what sounded like a very large boulder break loose and roll down the back of the hill.  I had assumed that Chris had rolled it down hoping to kick something out, but based on the last whistle, this rock was rolled from that area, and seemed to be 60 yards to my right, when Chris would have been twice that distance away from me.  I though that maybe he had gotten closer to me as we made our way up, but that would not have been the case in the past.  We work very well together and spacing is everyhting on our team hunts.<BR><BR>We got to the top of Pine Mountain, and we had a discusion and he told me that he thought I had rolled the boulder, and vice versa.  I told him about the whistle, and he told me the exact same thing.  He also had this overwhelming feeling of being followed up the hill.  Like something was timing it''s footfalls so as to not be detected.  I have to admit, I felt this way too, even more so after the discussion about the boulder.<BR><BR>",

      "observed": " : In August of 1982, my buddy and I made a weekend trip from Sunnyvale Ca. to Lassen National Park.  Having been there once before four years earlier with a church youth group, and consequently having had a blast, we wanted to camp in the same campground and generally do a lot of the things we had done on our first trip, but without the constraints of adult supervision. We where both twenty years old at this time. <BR><BR>We camped at a place called Lost Creek campground, which sits just inside Lassen National Park along its northern border with Lassen National Forest. On the second day we decided to take a late afternoon hike down an old somewhat overgrown logging road just on the other side of the national park/national forest boundary fence.  We knew of this road and its destination because we had hiked it four years earlier.  This road was lined with tree stumps, and had decades of old logging debris, and it had permanent tire grooves in the dirt.  As this road heads north down the slope from our campground it runs about 3000 ft., until it ends at a fire road running east to west.  We hiked west on this road about 100 yards to where the road runs along side a small meadow to the north. We hiked across this meadow to a creek called Lost Creek, hence the name of our camping site.<BR><BR>After soaking our feet in the icy water, my friend said we should probably head back up to camp as it was getting close to 7:00pm and he didn''t want too get stuck down there while it got dark.  We crossed the meadow back to the fire road and started walking east.  We then noticed on the road about 200 yards ahead of us, what at first glance appeared to be a large naked man with a dark complexion, walking away from us.  At second glance I thought maybe he isn''t naked but he''s wearing a fur coat with a pointy hood.  I remember saying to my friend \"take a look at this guy\". A few seconds later the figure stopped in its tracks and moved to the left side of the road, the whole time with its back to us.  I got the impression that he/it had noticed something and went to investigate.  A few seconds later it continued on its way with a very swift and deliberate gate, arms swinging slightly.<BR><BR>I think what sticks in my mind the most was the bawdiness of the shoulders.  In fact, I remember this character had a well defined hourglass figure.  He/it remained on the road for what seemed like a full minute, the entire time it was walking away from us, with his back to us. The more I watched the stranger I thought the situation was.  Eventually the figure disappeared from view, either around a bend in the road or up into forest to the left, I could not determine the direction.  We didn''t say too much about what we had just seen, however we seemed to walk a little more quickly back to camp.  I know I was a little nervous.  I can''t really put a size to this figure, because of the distance at which we viewed it, but if pressed, I would have to say it was over 6''5\" tall and about 270lbs., maybe even 300lbs. <BR><BR>The rest of the evening was uneventful, but the next morning at about 5:45am we both were awaken by what sounded to us, to be a series of powerful yelps and growls coming from the general direction of the area where we were hiking the day before.  I don''t know if any other campers in the area heard this. <BR><BR>My friend and I never really discussed this event among ourselves; or anyone else for several years, until for some reason, I brought it up once.  We still can''t come to an agreement on what we saw or heard.  I''ve told my wife about the incident, but very few others. I don''t know if my friend has told anyone. ",

      "observed": " On a day after the snow had fallen, we went hunting up in the Lake Hughes area in California. There were 4 of us hunting that day; my dad, and myself and 2 good buddies. Well, the deer hunting was not that good that day so one of my buddies said to us, my wife''s uncle is gone from his cabin and won''t be back any time soon, so why don''t we visit his land and all and just hang out and all and have some lunch. <BR><BR>Well, he lives by Lake Hughes''s road and close to where we were. We went over there and unlocked the gate as he had a key. We went in there and we had brought some apples for our lunch and all. We seen he had hogs and started feeding them these apples. After about 1/2 hour of doing this, we heard the horses behind the house or cabin, running around and making all kinds of noise. <BR><BR>We could not see what was going on as; the house was in the way. But, man were they going nuts!!!  So, we all said to each other, let''s get over there and see what''s up. We did and could not see anything but the horses still going nuts and running in circles. We then looked over this fence and threw a gate and seen these huge foot print''s and smelled something like a dog that''s been wet and rotten egg''s mixed. Well, the gate was locked and he went inside the cabin or house and got a key for the gate. <BR><BR>We went over to the prints, and I''m 6-5 at that time, and weighed 275 lbs. I have a shoe size of 15 4-E. These tracks were much bigger than my shoe and they were made, with some of them in the snow.  I stepped next to them and could not press down and going that deep! I could go maybe 3/4 - 1 inch down. These prints were 4 inches deep!! They were also, 2 to3 inches longer than my foot and much wider.<BR><BR>Then I tried to step that far with my step, and no way could I. Then we followed the tracks until they came to this really steep hill. There this thing went up this hill on 2 legs and stepped high enough that, even my good buddy who was a body builder and in great shape, could not climb. I could not even lift my leg that far, and I was 16 years old and pretty limber. No man could lift there leg that high or step that far! No man!!!  Nowhere did we see bear tracks and even if we did, they don''t walk that far on 2 legs. Whatever this was, it walked along this fence and turned and went back into the woods, and then up this very steep hill. It must have looked at the horses and maybe seen us feeding the hogs. I never seen it, but we got scared and left that ranch. <BR><BR>I have told this story to a few people, and they look at me like, it could be, but you can tell, they don''t think this is real.  But, when you see things like this, you just know something is out there. Nobody could change my mind on this one as, I know what I seen and it was not set up as, nobody knew we were going to his ranch, and the next ranch over, nobody was home there either. So, the only thing that could be is, this was real and not faked. Nowhere did we see any human foot prints by any of these tracks or up that steep hill. I know something is going on up there. <BR><BR>N. F.<BR>",

      "observed": " I believe this event took place in the late 1970&#8217;s to the very early 1980&#8217;s.  My best guess is 1978 or 1979.  My father, mother, younger brother and I were camping in a State Park off of Highway 101, in Mendocino County, CA.  Our parents were in their late thirties, I was 16 or 17 and my brother was 10 or 11.  (Of course these ages are approximate and may have been a year or two less or more).  We also had our dog with us, a 60-pound Black Lab - Dalmatian mix.  It was late July to early September and very likely Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day.  <BR><BR>The park in situated on both sides of the Eel River, and is for the most part second growth or new growth Redwood forest mixed with other trees and brush of the area.  The main section of the park is next to Highway 101. The far side of the park, away from the highway and across the river, is only open from the end of May to the middle of September.  The rest of the year the access bridge is removed and stowed above the high water line. The far side of the park has more foliage and is frequented by bear, deer, raccoon, skunks and other animals.  We were camping on the far side of the park as far up the hill as possible.<BR><BR>I believe this event occurred toward Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day for the following reasons; we had something of a ritual in making a final &#8220;end of the Summer&#8221; trip to this park, the park was very quiet meaning other campers had made an early start home to avoid holiday traffic or were not there at all being the weekend after Labor Day, and on this particular morning my father stayed in camp to do some paper work.  He was a high school math teacher so he usually did lesson plans or other work only in the late summer.<BR><BR>Mom, my brother, the dog and I decided to take a short hike up a trail on the edge of the campground.  The trail worked its way up over the crest of the hills for about two miles and ended above a barn and farm located in a clearing at the bottom of the other side of the hills.  The trail is mainly up hill, makes several cut backs, and passes across two or three unpaved fire roads.  It was a clear sunny day and there was no one else out on the trail.  <BR><BR>Our dog liked to take the point position to see the animals ahead.  She was an avid hunter of rabbits and liked to chase deer.  I had often seen her race after deer, taking dangerous inclines and thick brush at full speed.  On this day I do not recall her scaring up anything to chase.  The three of us talked as we went up the trail.  During the last half mile to quarter mile of the trail my mother gave us a serious order to stop. We paused while she looked and listened to an area behind us to our left.  She asked if we heard any thing, but I do not recall if my brother or I did.  <BR><BR>We walked on, more slowly now, listening to the forest.  After about 50 yards we felt like we could hear something moving in the woods, behind us to our left, and once again stopped.  The noise stopped when we stopped.  This time we indicated that we did hear it.  The dog was in the middle of the trail listening as well but did not go into the brush to investigate.  We continued on now for another 50-100 yards and we were almost to the crest and the vista area.  Again we thought we heard the noise paralleling us to our left but were not 100% sure.  We all stopped again.  Before we could again acknowledge the sound, there was a loud wooden knocking noise off to our right.  It was 3-4 quick &#8220;knock - knock - knock &#8211; knock&#8221;.  Initially I thought it was two tree trunks rubbing together in the wind.  I looked up to see if I could see anything, but there was no breeze.  Before I could look back down, there was a loud forceful huffing of air coming from the bottom of the tree.  It was something like a growl but not quite.  It was low and guttural, and was a rapid exhalation of air from a very large animal.  <BR><BR>Whatever it was, that was enough for us.  It was my mother who spun around and said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;  No one disagreed and we turned and sprinted all the way back to camp.  I think we covered the two miles without a stop.  Instead of taking the lead, the dog took up the rear position, which in my mom&#8217;s opinion was meant to protect us from whatever was behind us.  This was the first and only time we heard anything like that and was the only time we have ever even contemplated running in fear during a hike.  I do not recall any smell in the area. <BR><BR>The incident has never felt right to me and I have thought back to it on several occasions.  My mother has always thought that a bear was stalking us.  (She has always had a very strong apprehension of bears, and always warned us not to get between a cub and its mother, or try to feed a bear or approach any bear.  Nonetheless, we have chased them away on more than one occasion.).  I have heard of stalking behavior in bears before, but only in grizzlies, browns and polar bears &#8211; not in the California black bears.  Additionally, the behavior of the animal did not seem like a bear either, and did not elicit the response from our dog that I would have expected for a bear.  <BR><BR>I discovered this site about 12 months ago and the similarities of other&#8217;s reports with my incident made me think that this was a bigfoot.  Assuming the accuracy of other&#8217;s stories, it seems to be a more plausible explanation than being followed by a bear as well, as a better fit with the facts.  I spoke to my mother recently about it and she still felt it was a bear, besides she said, &#8220;Bigfoot are only up in the Pacific Northwest.&#8221;  I separately spoke to my father about this site and he thought I was pulling his leg.  After I told him that I believed the stories were sincere, and told him some of the common details of the events, he immediately brought up that time &#8220;you guys came running down from the trail.&#8221;<BR><BR>I did not send this sooner because it is a class B and twenty plus years old already.  I have heard a couple of stories regarding other incidents, but none that I have first or second hand knowledge of.   <BR><BR>What may be of interest is that I have seen a nest like the one in Report 2928.  I cannot recall exactly where I saw it but it was within the last 5 years.  It was some where in the Sierras, and I think it was in the Mammoth Lakes area.  I recall being off trail, cutting between lakes, or trying to relocate a trail when I saw it.  In any case it was well off the trail and quite a way from the town or trailhead.  Thinking it was a human&#8217;s hand made shelter, I was surprised at the amount of effort that must have went into building the little A frame.  It was tucked in between some tree trunks and the roof was a tight thatch of broken limbs.  It just struck me that a tent would have been easier to move and set up, and would have afforded better protection overall.  I glanced around but did not see any garbage or clothes or other signs of a camp.  There was no smell that I recall.  I was also surprised at how far away the nest was from the town &#8211; whoever this belonged to was trying to stay well away from the trail and others.  I guessed that it must belong to someone that really wanted to be left alone, so I went on my way.  <BR><BR><BR>",

      "observed": " Well it was summer time and I have about 30 acres of land off Highway 101, 11 miles north of Laytonville, California. A short distance north is Weott.  I have been a country girl all my life and have spent my life close to the land.  I had always been drawn to the forest and had slept outside when ever possible.  The weekends were made for pitching camp and swiming in the Rattlesnake Creek that runs along the foot of the property.  This time I wanted to spend the night along the side of the river by the deep pool we always swam in. The river has giant boulders to lay on and bask in the sun.  Both sides of the river are steep one side one side is so steep and gravel like you cant even climb it. <BR><BR>Well after much pleading with the people I had brought, they said ok we will camp on the river.  They were drinking a bit much and I was not going to touch it because I was worried they may decide to take a swim and sink.  We had fun with a small campfire we sat and laughed until it was late.  We rolled out our sleeping bags on the bank, the river at our feet and the steep cliff to our heads.  The spot we were in had a bit of a ledge high over our heads.I dont know what time it was when I woke up but I am a light sleeper and I heard the gravel over our heads being walked on. I lay still and listened.  It is moving across the top of the ledge toward my right. There is a deer trial that comes down to creek level about 10 feet away from where I am sleeping and I hear this person coming down it.  I was scared and tried to wake the people closest to me without making to much noise.  Then I kicked the person to my left and he snores louder.  <BR><BR>To my right, this person (I say person because it was two footed by the sound of it) was no more than 10 feet from me.  It stood behind a willow bush/baby tree it was really just 5 or six canes coming out of the stream bed.  It was dark but I could feel its size when it walked and shook the canes.  I kept thinking I am going to kill these @#% guys, why are they sleeping still? <BR><BR>Then the thing started yelling at me.  I know the sound of the animals in the California woods.  I have never heard this in my life.  It was yelling at us \"What the hell are you doing hear, this is my place.\"  It wasn''t like a mountain lion grawling and saying \"I''m tough and I can kick your [butt].\"  It was broken up into batches of sounds with inflections that I recognized. It was like a person speaking another language but you know they are telling you directly to get the hell out of my house.<BR><BR>I could see glimpses of it when its body moved into the light of the river.  Its right side was as tall as the canes I knew to be 8 foot-ish.  It ranted and raved and stomped and shook the bush.  I smelled skunk and thought \"Great this is all I need, they will bury me without a funeral because I am going to stink.\" I finally got my voice and said \"Ok Ok its alright ok ok .\" I did not see or hear it leave.  But I realized at some point it had left.  My encounter lasted only a few minutes but it felt much longer.  I stayed awake the rest of the night and I was so mad in the morning at my fellow campers.  I do not know if they believed me or not.  I could give a hoot.",

      "observed": " First, as a matter of background, I want to tell a little about myself. It will help explain the delay in ever having reposted this incident. The sighting occurred about three months prior to my entering the United States Army. I served for three years as a Paratrooper with a Top Secret Clearance. After my time in the service, I became a Los Angeles Police officer. I did that for thirteen years and am now a Federal Agent, working for an O.I.G. out of Washington DC. With that background, you can probably understand my reluctance to discuss this sighting with too many people. It really boils down to a potential career killer. <BR><BR>That being said the incident DID occur and I remember it vividly. Many many years after the event, I reconnected with my friend (the witness) and asked him to tell ME the story as he recalled it. I wanted to check my memory and see if his matched mine. It did. To a T! Only a few months ago, I spoke with my brother in law, a witness after the fact. I asked him if he remembered the event. He did. It should be known that he is not the kind of person that would \"buy into\" such a story, had he not been semi involved. <BR><BR>Anyway, this is what happened: My friend Craig and I were both 17 years old and waiting to leave for Army Basic Training. He was due to leave in June and I would go in August of 1980. We were staying with my Sister and Brother in Law at the time. They lived in a cabin in Green Valley California. Craig and I enjoyed our last months as civilians in that area, and used it to train for the difficult training ahead of us. We ran every day along the mountain roads and hiked the hills, trying to get into prime shape. <BR><BR>In May, we decided to test ourselves and camp out for a full seven days. We knew the perfect place for this would be what we called \"The old campground\" because of its isolated surroundings and terrain that would be perfect for climbing and hiking. So, we packed up a weeks worth of supplies and, though my sister Cindy and her husband Tom offered to drive us, we decided to act like soldiers and walk to the location. We did this with full packs. <BR><BR>My sister and Tom advised us that they would check on us at least every other day and that they would bring us food and lemonade and such. Tom also, offered to provide us with two weapons to be used for protection against any strangers that may try to harm us. After all this was before cell phones and we would be on our own big-time. There was also a heavy rattlesnake threat in that area, so we happily took him up on the offer. Tom met us at an area near the mine shafts later that day and gave us an M-1 rifle and a 12 gauge shotgun, with ammo for both.<BR><BR>The dirt trail that leads off of the main highway goes very far back into the mountains. In fact, were you to traverse it to its end, you would end up on top of what is known as Grass Mountain. Craig and I decided to get about three miles in and away from the highway, which was about a mile past what once was an old 1920s campground, and live deep in the bush like soldiers would. We found a great spot, next to a clear running creek and set up our tent in the clearing that was there. This clearing was completely surrounded by thick woods. Then night fell.<BR><BR>As we lay in our tent talking by the light of flashlights, we both heard the very loud snap of deadfall in the woods behind the tent. We sat up, frozen and listening. We heard what sounded like a very large and heavy person, slowly walking around our site, making no effort to conceal his presence, judging from the loud sound of breaking sticks and brush. We were both scared believing that someone was out there. We exited the tent, Craig with a shotgun and me with the M-1. I started yelling very loud. \"Hey! We know you are there. We have guns and will shoot!\" <BR><BR>Again, we heard the sound of someone walking slowly but methodically around from our left to right. We shinned our lights in the direction but could not see anything but the trees and brush. We talked amongst ourselves, wondering if it could be a bear or something, but we decided that it was a person and not an animal. After much yelling and warning that we would shoot, I decided to fire a few rounds in the direction of the noise (how crazy that sounds now) and I did just that. I fired about three rounds into the trees and the sound was unbelievable. <BR><BR>The weapon blasted and the sound echoed into the night, roaring into the canyons and fading off into the night air. We stood in silence. To our utter disbelief and eventual horror whatever it was, began to move again, still left to right, in a circle around us. What we both thought and discussed later, was that NO animal would have stuck around after the horrific noise of the M-1. Most normal people would not have stuck around either! Whoever or whatever was out there not only stuck around, but appeared, from the casual sound of the slow walking, to be less than concerned about our weapons. We made a decision to vacate the area post haste! Grabbing our coats, we climbed the embankment up to the dirt road, and carrying our weapons, we ran the entire way, about three miles more or less, back to the main highway, San Francisquito Canyon Rd. We spent a very long night, curled up in a concrete drainage ditch, waiting for the sun to rise. Every hour or so, a lone truck would come by and the sound of that brought us comfort. Again, it was a long night!<BR><BR>The next day, we hiked back to the site, expecting to find our tent and all of our supplies missing. To our surprise, everything was as we had left it. Nothing was out of place. We gathered our things, and hiked back to the open area of the old campground. We decided not to sleep in the tent because it limited our vision, and instead, laid our sleeping bags out in an open area, above the creek. After a day of climbing cliffs and cooking and such, night fell again.<BR><BR>That night, just as the sun set and darkness was beginning to fall, Craig and I were walking in the direction of the main road. We were looking for rattle snakes, because we had shot one earlier on the dirt road in the same area. As we walked side by side with me on the left, both holding weapons, we saw it. Standing just on the dirt road, facing us was a Bigfoot. There can be NO DOUBT at all about what it was. We could see it very clearly. He was about eight or nine feet tall and stood with his left shoulder even with the edge of the trail. He was covered with dark hair and had long arms. We did NOT smell anything unusual, as I have since read about other sightings. <BR><BR>The strange thing about him was the absolute indifference in his expression. He did not look threatening. He did not look scared. He just stood there looking at us.almost bored. I instinctively brought my right hand up against Craig''s chest and we both stopped dead in our tracks. We never took our eyes off of the Bigfoot as we spoke. I said, \"Do you see that? Are we seeing this?\" Craig said, What do we do? What should we do?\" We both started to walk backwards as we spoke, very slowly and involuntarily. The Bigfoot just looked at us for a few moments. <BR><BR>Then, and I will NEVER forget the detail of this he just slowly and very casually turned to his left, and began to walk into the forest. When he did that, Craig and I stopped and started talking over each other. \"Do we shoot it? Should we shoot it? What do we do? Do you want to follow it?\" As we talked, we heard a sound that we both immediately recognized from the prior night, the sound of the Bigfoot slowly walking deeper into the woods, breaking deadfall, twigs and branches as he went. We never did fire a shot or follow him. We stayed up late and slept in shifts at the campground and did not hear from the Bigfoot again.<BR><BR>The next day, Tom came up with food and supplies. We ran to him and told him the details of what had happened. It was very clear by his expression that he did not believe us. We took him to the exact spot where we saw the Bigfoot and we discovered a trail of giant footprints leading from the trail into the woods. Tom smiled and told us that we did a good job making them. We were so frustrated and begged Tom to follow the tracks with us. We all followed them and they went into and across the creek. On the other side, we found a large red ant hill with a footprint right on top of it. I asked Tom, how could we have done that? He just shook his head and smiled. We followed the tracks to a point where two large hills formed a valley that sloped upwards into the mountain area. The ground turned rocky and the prints stopped. <BR><BR>That is what happened. I have lived with this memory for many years. I am now Forty Five years old and am less concerned about what people think of me in terms of this incident. It is a fact and because of it, I know for sure that Bigfoot lives or at least once lived in the area of Green Valley California. <BR>",

My friend was just out of boot camp USMC and we started hiking as often as time would allow.<BR><BR>We were hiking down a small stream bed that went down hill. The stream was all dried up and it was mostly rock hopping until we got to the bottom of the hill, at one point there is a small section off to the side that is just dirt and makes for a much easier walk down to the bottom.<BR><BR>When we got to the bottom we hiked a bit more but as the sun started to go down, we headed back up the same hill/creek bed. I followed my own boot tracks back up as I was tired of rock hopping, while going up, the smell in the air was horrible, like rotten eggs or portable toilet, I then noticed on one of my tracks laid a dead ground squirrel, right over my boot track. I pointed this out to my friend and as soon as I did this, a loud banging over a short hill side was heard, it was coming from about 35-50 yards away from us. It sounded as if it was a large log being hit against a tree.<BR><BR>I looked at where the noise was coming from and noticed the tops of the trees were swaying back and forth; all this time of the swaying of the trees the pounding on them could be heard.<BR><BR>Then the pounding stopped and a loud groan/scream was heard from the same area as the pounding of the trees. I have never heard anything like it. Ive heard Mt Lion, Black bear, this was nothing like that, and was very-very loud, to the point is was damn scary. My friend asked if we should look over the small hillside to see what was making the noise. I said no way, and he agreed. When we started walking away the banging and screaming would stop, but as soon as we stopped it would proceed with the groan and screaming and the trees would start swaying.<BR><BR>We finally got out of there and my friend did not want to talk about what had happened.<BR><BR><BR>",

We made it up to the saddle where the trail goes downhill into the wilderness, and where we were supposed to leave the trail and go south up the mountain, and decided we didn''t feel like going any further. I''m assuming we rested for awhile, and I remember just talking and hanging out. As we were getting up and ready to go, we heard a strange noise coming from the bushes nearby. We stopped talking and listened, and it was a very low sort of growl/snuffling sound. My first thought was that it was probably a bear, but that ultimately I had no idea what it was, and it sounded like it was growling at us. The bushes along the trail there were very high, such that we couldn''t see through them. It scared the hell out of us and so we quickly hoofed it back down the trail. I''m not sure if we ever spoke about it again, except to maybe say I wonder what it was, that was scary, etc.<BR><BR>But afterwards I actually looked through field guides trying to figure out what was making the noise. I knew that bears, mountain lions & bobcats are relatively prevalent in that part of the San Gabriel Mountains, so assumed it was probably one of those. But, after browsing around your site, and seeing several sightings near the SG Wilderness listed, I''m beginning to wonder. In retrospect (although it could be my overactive imagination), it sounded a bit apelike. VERY low-pitched, so that we almost couldn''t hear it at all, and had to ask each other, \"Do you hear that?\"<BR><BR>Take it as you must; I just think it''s interesting in the context of the other sightings in the area. I only wish I could remember any more details, and that we had had the cajones to hang around longer and check it out further.<BR>",

We knew the routine well.<BR><BR>About 50 yards into the bush, Greg and I both noticed that someone (human) was walking in front of us, about 20 feet ahead. We both stopped. The footsteps took two steps more, then stopped. Greg and I looked at each other, surprised, and simultaneously, drew our Buck knives. We couldn''t see anything. We proceeded cautiously, our knives drawn. <BR><BR>The footsteps continued in front of us. After about 30 feet, we came to the edge of a clearing and stopped. Two more steps and \"it\" stopped again. Only this time in the middle of the clearing.

I was a boy when my brother-inlaw of that day and one or two of his hunting friends had an excellant and fairly long term sighting, both via their eyes and through high powered rifle scopes. <BR><BR>However I can relate some of this information to you and even put you in touch with two of the possible three people, can''t guarantee they will talk with you about the sighting, but one never knows. In fact I spoke with my ex-brother in-law about this earlier this evening because I happened upon your website and explored it.<BR> <BR>What is very significant is that Sam and Don had every opportunity to shoot this animal and/or person and thought about it, but could not because it looked to human! <BR><BR>Only THREE DAYS later Big Foot reports hit the news. My father and Sam AKA Sandy, in front of me took a forest map out and Sam became quiet as the new sightings were only 15 miles from his encounter, and in the direction the creature was traveling. The newer sightings as I recall put the creature near Pear Blossum, CA on the other side of the mountains. I remember a news report of 1000 people lined up across the desert looking for anything and they did find some hair on a barbwire fence. To this day I know of no one having reported this first encounter three days prior. <BR><BR>Another significant item is that in those days bear season and deer season overlaped or was one in the same. At first they thought this might be a deforemed bear (they had bear tags) as they witnessed this being walking on two legs just like any human and appeared to be 7 to 8 feet tall. <BR><BR>They were a few hundred yards away on the other side of the caynon, (don''t remember the name of the caynon) but their rifle scopes allowed them to see this clearly enough that viewing the face and shape they could not decide if this was an animal or a human. I remember Sandy/Sam saying it looked like a monkey man. The animal/person seemingly did not know they were there. They had bear tags and thought about shooting the creature but as I said could not make themselves do it. I recall Sam telling my father that it had to be a bear because it dropped to all fours when it climbed the steeper terrain. My father asked Sam: How did you guys climb it? The reply was the same as the deformed bear. <BR><BR>About then my brother in-law was no longer jovial regarding the sighting and preffered not to discuss the incident. Until now I have more or less left the man alone about it. Today he is a Plant Manager for a large trailer company. <BR><BR>Don still lives in Baldwin Park, CA but maybe moving to San Diego, CA. I seldom cross paths with Don nor have I never pursued the matter with him. If you folks are interested I can put you in touch with both of them but you may have to settle for what I have related. Without the permission of at lest one of the actual witnesses it might not be right to post this information.  <BR><BR>As for myself today I am 40 years old and drive for MTA and I am use to making out reports. I understand the need for accuracy without exaggeration. I hope this relayed information was not to long winded and useful. <BR><BR>Tim P. <BR> <BR>Tim P. only heard this story 2nd hand as a youth.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

We parked in an area just below the ridge where when the sun lightened up enough we could easily hike up to the top in about 20 minutes. As it got light enough to see the top, we noticed someone already on the ridge wearing what seemed to be black of all things. He had no light, and no gun, and we wondered where he came from because we had been camped there for 11 days, and no one had come by that whole time. We watched him dig around in some brush for at least 30 minutes, pausing occasionaly for long periods to just stare in different directions. We joked that it was probably a hunter from L.A. because anyone would be crazy to wear just black during deer, and bear season. Then he began to walk down the hill right for us, now we never left the truck yet, and he would walk a little ways and the stop and look around just as if he was hunting, but with no rifle. He walked just like a human, so at this time there was no reason to think it was anything but a man. After a little while it was getting light enough to see even better, and he was still walking straight for us. When he was about 50 yards away we both at the same time realized we were not watching a man, but this was a Bigfoot! He walks like a man, but he was not a man. He had jet black, shiny fur, with a reddish color around where his eyes were. At this moment I was ready to run clear home in one leap! I had to see this thing up close, and he had not noticed us yet, so I tried to open the door of the truck real easy so he wouldn''t notice, but that old ford truck was anything but quiet, and he heard the latch release and took one good look before breaking into a run. I tried to bring the scope up to view him closer, but this guy could really move, and I could not get my eye into the scope before he got behind a tree and nev er came out. It took all the nerve in my body to walk over to the tree, but he was not there he flat disappeared. My friend was hollering the whole time not shoot, and thought I was crazy for trying to go find him, or a track, or something. All I know is I have different kind of respect for the back woods now, and I give a lot of room between me and large objects. I was brought up in these woods camping, and hunting every year and only heard of such things.",

He has since past away when he was hit unexpectedly by a semi truck. He told me was hunting with his son, watching him zig zag up a hill around noon,in 1970 when a bigfoot walked between him and his son the whole time the bigfoot never took his eyes off his son. He felt that it did not intend any harm so he did not get alarmed. The fist time he said he was parked in the same place, and he was in his camper again around noon reading a book when someone walked by and waved to him through the side window. He didn''t hear anyone drive up so he thought he would go out and say high. There was no one there, and then he realized the window was at least seven and a half feet above the ground, it could not have been a mere man.",

While running accross a talus field in a remote area of the western Clark range, I came across pits in the talus where granite blocks had been lifted up and stacked in neat piles about 3 or 4 feet high.  The rocks were angular, about 2 to 3 feet long, and the biggest of them may have weighed a couple hundred pounds.  The resulting pits in the talus were maybe 5 feet deep.  There was one big pit of that size and 1 or 2 less distinct ones perhaps half as deep.  The area was at least a couple of miles from any trail, or any prominent location that anyone would go to, like a lake or a climbing area.  As I recall, I was basicly running in a straight line, more or less, from the Clark Range to the Mist Trail region.<BR><BR>I read Bigfoot books as a kid, and immediately recognzed them as Sasquatch sign, but since I was in a hurry, and not too sure if I belived in him or not, I only spent a few minutes in examination.<BR><BR>Bigfoot foraging for rodents?

This was definately not trail construction, as it was in a very obscure area without tourist acsess,  but why waste time lifting boulders in the middle of nowhere?<BR><BR>As far as my credibility goes,  I grew up in an \"outdoors family.\"  I lived in the park about 5 years and got around quite a bit.

No stranger let alone an animal could come close to our dog as he was an agressive watchdog. The whining is what woke me up.  I looked out the window from the couch and then looked again trying to focus. It was dark and everybody else was sleeping. I saw a dark outline of a creature looking into the front room.  I saw its silhouette against the night sky.  It had to have been taller than 6 foot, and the window, if I remember correctly, was off the ground 3? feet and the window itself was 4? feet tall.  The creature took up the width of the window and there probably was about 6-8 inches of moonlit sky showing above its head.  It made no sound.  It just stood there looking in.  I don''t remember anything else.  I probably thought I must be dreaming, but the impression of something watching me never left me and I never told anyone about it until I told a trusted friend about a year ago.  However, other members of my family, including myself at that period of time, heard sounds that summer--like a low, steady whistle, sounding almost like a wind blowing through a groove of some kind.  This happened more than once.  When one of my uncles investigated with a rifle one night while we were playing cards, he came back shaken and unable to explain why.  The night would be silent except for the whistle noise.<BR><BR>Another time, I went exploring down the creek which ran out of a pond.  I got to the bottom of the ravine.  There was a smell, like sulphur, or something rotting, at a place where the water pooled.  It scared me and I ran back up the mountain.  I did not tell anyone because I was not suppose to go beyond the sight of the house.  ",

One of the investigations was a night time walk up a hill at a rancher''s property in Covelo; earlier in the week, from what I remember hearing, was a Bigfoot had been interacting twice with his horses, which he chased off, so we hit that spot. Except me, I stayed in the car with a video game and a flashlight onhand. Maybe 10-15 mins after everyone else took off up the hill, I noticed a movement by the rear passenger window at the driver''s side of the car, something a gold-tan color was standing by the back window. Turned off the interior light in the car and sat in the dark a little while, maybe 4-5 mins, then turned it back on. Whatever it was came back to the window again; this time I heard what I guess has to be described as ''patting/palming'' the door of the car. I about lost it then, ( I dont scare, so this is really strange), and turned off the light, didnt turn it back on till everyone else came back down the hill. Just before people returned, I saw something run past the car really fast, up toward the front of the car line ( we had 4 cars there, I was in the last one). No one else saw the running whatever, they checked the door but didnt see any muddy handprints or anything on it. Im still frazzled, been dealing with all types of wild animals  since I was a kid ( aunt worked witha  zoo and Ive done wildlife rehab since I was a kid).

We are San Francisco City people, artist; not hunters. We are not used to the outdoors or accustom to the forest and nature and the shock of fresh clean air.<BR><BR>The first encounter was on Tuesday evening, 8/16/05 at 5:17pm on highway 128 in the Redwood forest. We were on a vacation, driving west on 128 and heading towards Fort Bragg, CA. Once we entered the state park, we stopped and parked to smell the fresh air. I marked the time, because I was shooting with my digital camera. We walked into the forest, on a trail, and were having a great time, enjoying our time alone. There was little traffic or noise from the road. The forest was quiet and powerful. We have lived in the center of San Francisco for 15 years, and were stunned and amazed to experience the silence and peace of the Redwoods. As we got deeper into the woods, about 20 minutes, I started to get uneasy; feeling like someone was watching us. The digital photos my wife took of me show my concern, the longer we stayed. Then we heard it.  It was a growl-grunting. Just above the hearing of my ears. I would described it as infra-sound- a deep sound that was low in pitch, deep, almost inaudible. My body felt it more than my ears. It threw me in a panic. The fear in me rose fast. I looked at my wife and she was feeling the panic. We both looked around. We could not tell the direction. We could not see anything in the thick woods around us. It could have been a bear or a wolf. But my instincts said no. I did not know what it was. But, the \"vibe\" message was becoming clear- GO AWAY NOW! <BR><BR>Predators do not warn-they ambush-right? My wife looked at me and said Did you hear that? I said Yes. She said, Lets get back to the car. I said Good idea!  It was a weird feeling. We were stunned and mystified as we ran back to the car. We drove away nervous and excited about what happened. On our way to Fort Bragg, CA, we were talking about the experience. Was it a bigfoot? Did we have a Bigfoot encounter? We felt something special had just happened. We had to learn more about bigfoots.  <BR><BR>Over the year, I became obsessed with bigfoots. I read as mush as I could about the Sasquatch, Yeren, Almasty, and Yeti as my time permit. My wife became obsessed also. Together we decided to go back to those redwoods and try to make contact with the forest giants. <BR><BR>We made it back to highway 128 on Monday 9/4/06. Something told me to pull over at a different spot. As soon as I got out, I had the DV video camera running. On the camera my wife tells me to make my Whoop-Whoop Bigfoot call, into the redwood forest. As soon as I did, the camera records wood knocking and tree breaking. Soon the smell of a dead animal/skunk filled the air. <BR><BR>The sounds and smells go on for about three minutes,  then stops. I could tell he moved away after my calls to him, inviting him to be photographed. We left the redwood forest, excited about our contact. <BR><BR>My wife wants to see a bigfoot. I do not want to see him.  I hear that many people die or have very bad luck after seeing a Bigfoot. Remember Dr. Morbius from the movie Forbidden Planet? Maybe Bigfoot is the ID, coagulated from the quantum soup of our collective unconscious mind. Maybe, Bigfoot is us.",

      "observed": " Last night, Jan.16,2005, I took my dog outside for a little walk. We live on 2 acres in Redwood Valley, CA.  It was dark and about 6:00 with a mod. overcast sky, the moon peeking through the clouds. We have a small dog that will usually bark in response to any other dog barking in our area.  Houses are well-spaced on our rolling hillside that''s covered with a mix of oak and pines. From Hwy. 101 looking west, you see very few houses on our hillside. Anyway, as I was walking I could hear this very unusual \"animal\" sound unlike any I''ve heard before. It was NOT a dog howling and I''m not even sure how to describe it. We have coyotes and mountain lions and the sound would not fit the description of their cries or calls either. It had a yelling/howl quality that lasted about 5 seconds , would break off and then resume about 15 seconds later. I went in the house to get my husband so that he could hear the sound. My dog was not barking which is really unusual because he''s inclinded to bark at dogs or other unfamiliar sounds.  None of the dogs on our hillside were barking either which seemed odd to me. I was kind of scared .  My husband came out and listened. His initial response was, \"Anyway, it''s on the other side of that hill.\" I said, \"It''s not a dog, and our dog is not barking at it.\"  He agreed it was strange but wasn''t concerned. Soon thereafter, a dog could be heard barking and our dog started in with his typical barking response. The unusual sound stopped and I didn''t hear it again. This is not the first time we''ve heard  unusual sounds that we can''t identify. We woke up one night hearing whooping sounds outside the house that I can''t connect with any animal I''m familiar with. My daughter has also heard whooping sounds on the same hillside where we heard the unusual sounds last night. My teenage son heard whooping sounds last summer in the manzanita to the north of our house. We had an odd experience last summer. My college aged son and his friends were imitating \"Big Foot\" sounds that they''d heard on the internet . It was about 11:00 at night when they were fooling around , loudly imitating the sounds.  About 1:00 AM, that same night, we were watching a video and we heard a scratching at the window. We all thought my son was outside trying to scare everyone. All of a sudden , water was splashing all over the side of the house. A water sprinkler pipe outside the window had been snapped off, and water was geysering out of the pipe. My son walked out of the bathroom and it turned out he''d been in the house all along. No one had been outside and we still wonder how the pipe was snapped off. Whatever had been scratching at the window had apparently broken the pipe.  We all wondered if it was a response to the Big Foot calls that the guys had been making. Anyway, here''s a synopsis of a few incidents. We decided to post these after last nights occurrence of the strange, unidentifiable call.",

As we listened we heard a creature moving through the forest making very loud crashing sounds. The creature stopped; it was silent for a moment perhaps it saw us watching. Then we heard a grunting sound which became a very low frequency but loud moo, like a cow but deeper in pitch and  much more intense. The creature''s yell went from a \"moo\" sound to a very high pitch scream unlike any sound I ever heard before or ever will again. After the creature yelled it took off again through the forest heading inland it took only a few seconds and it was to far away to hear the foot steps anymore. <BR>This animal sounded like no other and moved fast.<BR>Even a cow running through the forest could not make the sounds we heard or cover the same distance as quickly.<BR>It was a Big Foot.",

I was not able to make it to dinner on time because I had a bloody nose and needed to lay down for a few minutes.<BR><BR>After about 5 minutes, I returned to the nearby restroom to clean up and that''s when the incident occurred. What I didn''t see because of high bushes between me and the sound, I did hear very clearly. I heard footsteps in the brush above the restroom. Whatever it was, was moving very slowly. I remember thinking that it was either a person walking very leisurely or something bigger walking at a normal gait. I didn''t quite know what to do so, on an impulse, I made a growling sound. Then the footsteps stopped, but resumed a few seconds later. I repeated the growl and the same thing happened. Since I was alone and frankly a bit nervous since there was not supposed to be anyone else up in the woods with me at that time, I decided to go to dinner. I told some fellow campers about the incident during dinner and they were all a bit skeptical.<BR><BR>But after dinner we returned to the area and decided to head toward the exact spot where the footstep sounds were emanating from. I knew before seeing the footprints what I had heard since there had been stories of sightings in the area. The ground was very solid but I managed to make out several manlike footprints in the dirt, only they were much larger. My fellow campers verified what I saw. We decided to try and follow the prints, but since they were so shallow it was difficult to determine the direction the creature had taken.<BR><BR>But within a few minutes, our job was made easier because I once again heard the mysterious footstep noise. This time a fellow camper and myself decided to chase the creature making the noise so we took off running in the direction of the noise. After about a minute of running uphill, I brought us to a halt to listen. We now heard the creature running away from us very quickly. We pursued it for a few more minutes, but the only thing we found was one set of toe-prints in the area where the creature had been running from us. Of special note: I do not recall experiencing the bad odor that it supposed to be associated with the Bigfoot creature.",

      "observed": " Well, I think it was 1977. I was squatting in the woods out by a little lake road of Mendocino, California. I''ve spent most of my life in the woods of California or Maine. Even had resident pet black bears that would come to the open dump at the back of the property.<BR><BR>One night, I''m laying in my tent. I don''t remember if it was late (2 am) and I woke up, or if it was earlier in the night (say 11 pm) and I was just going to sleep. Through the woods (about fifty yards away is my guess) the stomping and crashing of smaller trees started going on. It was loud. I was surprised at first and a little afraid because I was squatting illegally on state property.<BR><BR>With my familiarity of the noises of the night in the woods, I listened carefully to try to determine or identify what was making the noise. My first assessment was that it was bi-ped ... not a bear or a deer. Realizing this scared me the most.<BR><BR>Understanding the force necessary to cause the destructive sounds I was listening to scared me even further. I don''t know if profanity is allowed or acceptable, but i was more effing afraid than I could ever remember, praying that what I was listening to wouldn''t start moving towards my tent.<BR><BR>The noise sounded like a two-legged monster crashing through the woods hastily as if trying to make quick time CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH !!! It was then I realized that I heard a dog (or two, I don''t remember) barking in pursuit. Gratefully, the noise was not coming towards me and I suspected that whatever was moving so quickly and violently through the woods was trying to elude the dog(s). <BR><BR>I think this whole event lasted about 30 seconds and then the crashing stopped. Then the next scariest thing happened. The dog barked a few more times and then it made that sound dogs make when they are brutally injured. After that, I did not hear a single damned thing except the fear white-noise inside my head.<BR><BR>You know ...<BR><BR>I worked as a split-maker for a year on LP land in Mendocino County and as a timber operator for about five years east of Fort Bragg and Mendocino. I worked alone very often. I was surprised to read a post on this website wherein the person who wrote it also said they often felt (and somehow knew) they were not alone when in the woods. I would turn off my chainsaw now and then and I could \"feel\" something watching me.<BR><BR>The last strange thing I would share with you about the 22 years of my life 2 - 12 miles east of Fort Bragg in the woods is the frequent discovery of disemboweled animals. Simply that ... disemboweled ... the rest of the animal intact. <BR><BR>What an eclectic mix we are in the wonderful County of Mendocino. Please keep as anonymous as possible and do not publish my telephone number. Thank you.<BR><BR>Regards to you and yours during this part of the year and the upcoming new year. <BR><BR>**********************************************************************<BR>I forgot to follow up on the morning after this encounter. I found what would be considered normal damage made by a large creature thrashing through the woods. No obvious signs that it was or wasn''t Sasquatch. No obvious signs that the dogs had been killed or maimed. I moved my tent to be sure.",

We still didn''t believe him until he said, \"I paid $700 dollars for my deer rifle 3 years ago and I just dropped it and ran.\" Then we noticed that he didn''t have his rifle and the goosebumps hit us both.

The human did not have any clothes on, and was not carrying a rifle, and was coming my way up canyon.  I watched the bigfoot as he came nearer, to try and figure out what it was.  As the bigfoot became almost even with me across canyon, it disappeared into the manzanita, about 80 yards away.  I then heard a jeep on the above dirt road. By the time I looked back to where the bigfoot was, he already had come back out of the brush and was walking uphill. He was about 7'' tall and had a slender body like a basketball player with big strong shoulders, and a real skinny waist. The legs were really muscular, and strong.  The arms were long, as were the fingernails, and fingers. He had no clothes on whatsoever, and the bigfoot&#8217;s body was covered with about 2\" of hair with a few bald spots showing skin.  Its hair was black, and cut off about even with the upper neck. Its forehead was gunpowder gray with the temple area being purple red down the side of the face partway then dark tan.  The face was flat with a flat nose.  It walked hunched over with his arms at a dead hang as he walked.<BR><BR>After I made this sighting I went back the following weekend to look around some more for what I had seen. I walked up the same trail bigfoot walked up, and found a steer skull laying in the trail.  I picked the skull up and looked at it, and it was completely clean underneath without a cobweb or a speck of dirt. I sat it down exactly how I found.  I went back two weeks later and the skull was gone.  Maybe it was a migration route, and others were following.",
