THE COALITION INCLUDES THE STATES OF WASHINGTON, OREGON, AND MONTANA, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM TRIBAL NATIONS, LABOR, BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY, HIGHER EDUCATION, GOVERNMENT, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY SPANNING THE REGION. THIS AWARD WILL ASSIST TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST TO BUILD OUT THE REGIONAL CLEAN HYDROGEN ECONOMY. AS PROPOSED, THE PNWH2 HUB WILL FOCUS ON DEMONSTRATING LOW-CARBON INTENSITY AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION AND USE IN HARD-TO-DECARBONIZE SECTORS TO REPLACE CARBON-INTENSIVE PROCESSES, INCLUDING HARD-TO-ELECTRIFY HEAVY-DUTY TRANSPORTATION, SEAPORTS, AGRICULTURE, AND INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS. THE HUB\u2019S EFFORTS WILL ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND ENABLE INFRASTRUCTURE, ATTRACT GREATER INVESTMENTS FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, AND PROMOTE HIGH-QUALITY JOBS IN REGIONAL COMMUNITIES WITH A STRONG FOCUS ON SOCIAL EQUITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AS GUIDING PRINCIPLES. PHASE 1 INCLUDES PLANNING, ANALYSIS, DESIGN, AND COMMUNITY, TRIBAL AND LABOR ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, FOR MULTIPLE HYDROGEN PROJECTS, AND FACILITIES ACROSS THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. THE PNWH2 HUB IS COMMITTED TO INCORPORATING COMMUNITY INPUT, SUPPORT, AND CONCERNS INTO DECISION MAKING TO PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS. DURING PHASE 1, THIS INCLUDES MONITORING AND SITING DECISIONS, COMMUNITY AND TRIBAL INTERESTS, CONCERNS AND PRIORITIES FOR THE PROJECT, WORKFORCE GAPS, AND INITIAL ENGAGEMENT WITH LABOR UNIONS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS ON LOCAL HIRING, FAIR WAGES, AND BENEFITS.

THE PROGRAM WILL EDUCATE AND TRAIN 4 TO 6 MINORITY STUDENTS ANNUALLY WITH SKILLS IN ADVANCED SORPTION MATERIALS FOR DIRECT AIR CAPTURE (DAC). SPECIFICALLY, A NOVEL ENZYME- CATALYZED HOLLOW FIBER SORBENT (ECHFS) WITH FAST CO2 ADSORPTION KINETICS WILL BE DEVELOPED BY TWO STEPS: (I) FABRICATION OF HYDROPHILIC POLYVINYLIDENE FLUORIDE (PVDF) GRAFTED L-LYSINE (PVDF-G-LYS) POROUS HOLLOW FIBERS WITH RICH AMINE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS; AND (2) IMMOBILIZATION OF A HIGH-TEMPERATURE RESISTANT CARBONATE ANHYDRASE (CA) MIMIC, ZINC (II)-CYCLEN, TO THE PVDF-G-LYS HOLLOW FIBER THROUGH VACUUM FILTRATION. THE INTEGRATION OF RICH AMINE GROUPS AND IMMOBILIZED CA MIMIC AS A CATALYST ON THE EASY-TO- SCALABLE PVDF HOLLOW FIBERS CAN SYNERGISTICALLY PROMOTE THE DAC PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF HIGH CO2 ADSORPTION CAPACITY, FAST CO2 ADSORPTION RATE, AND LOW HEAT OF ADSORPTION AT DILUTE CO2 CONDITION"
