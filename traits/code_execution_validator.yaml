cascade_id: code_execution_validator
description: Validates that code was executed successfully (no errors, has output)
inputs_schema:
  content: The phase output to validate
cells:
- name: validate
  instructions: |-
    Check if the following content shows that code was executed successfully:

    ---
    {{ input.content }}
    ---

    Look for:
    1. Actual execution output (numbers, results, print statements)
    2. NO error messages (Exit code, Traceback, Error:, etc.)
    3. Evidence that the solution worked

    Return JSON:
    {"valid": true, "reason": "..."} if code executed successfully with output
    {"valid": false, "reason": "..."} if errors present or no execution happened

    Be strict: Only return valid=true if you see ACTUAL execution output without errors.
