Your job is to determine if the produced output actually satisfies the original request.\n\n**ORIGINAL REQUEST:**\n{{ input.original_input | tojson }}\n\n**PRODUCED OUTPUT:**\n{{ input.content }}\n\n---\n\nEvaluate objectively:\n\n1. **Does the output address what was requested?**\n   - Check if all key requirements are met\n   - Verify completeness and relevance\n\n2. **Is the quality satisfactory?**\n   - Is it clear and understandable?\n   - Is it accurate and well-formed?\n   - Does it provide value?\n\n3. **Would a reasonable person consider this request fulfilled?**\n   - Not just \"good enough\" but actually satisfactory\n   - Consider if you'd accept this if you made the request\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- DO NOT just look for phrases like \"I'm satisfied\" - that's self-reporting, not validation\n- Judge the ACTUAL QUALITY and COMPLETENESS of the work\n- Be objective and fair, but maintain reasonable standards\n- If something is clearly incomplete, low-effort, or doesn't address the request, mark invalid\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with this exact format:\n{\"valid\": true/false, \"reason\": \"objective explanation of whether the output satisfies the original request\", \"issues\": [list of specific gaps or problems if not satisfied]}\n\nMark as valid (true) ONLY if the output genuinely satisfies the original request.\nMark as invalid (false) if it's incomplete, off-topic, low-quality, or doesn't fulfill what was asked.",
